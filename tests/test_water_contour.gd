# r3-task-2 (plan docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-10-water-continuous-surface.md,
# brief .superpowers/sdd/r3-task-2-brief.md) recorded the RED evidence that the
# pre-WaterContour boundary (the old marching-squares mesher's own
# perimeter-walk on a 3m sub-grid) produces angular, grid-quantized corners:
# max_turn_deg (raw, all corners) = 90.00 at SITE_CHUNK, isolated skip-guard
# active, transcript preserved in .superpowers/sdd/r3-task-2-report.md ("Red
# run transcript" section — 9 offending corners, 45-90 degree turns, all on
# the OLD mesher's own boundary). r3-task-3 (.superpowers/sdd/
# r3-task-3-brief.md) is what makes this GREEN: WaterContour.curves() now
# EXISTS and replaces the boundary source entirely — this file's
# test_pond_yields_smooth_closed_curve below is the direct GREEN half of that
# red-green pair, measuring the NEW curve's own turn angle instead of walking
# the old mesher's free edges (the old _sheet_free_edges/_chain_edges/_is_wall
# mesh-walking helpers this file used to carry are gone: WaterContour.curves()
# supplies pts/wall/normals directly, so there is no mesh to walk any more).

## test_border_curves_weld — the plan's chunk-seam-determinism constraint
## made concrete: two neighbouring chunks' own curves() calls must agree on
## every point that lands on their shared border, at an EXPLICIT 1e-4
## distance ceiling (the brief's own "bit-equality target; tolerance 1e-4
## max"). NOTE: the first version of this test used Vector2.is_equal_approx,
## which is a RELATIVE comparison — at world coordinates ~1000-4000 its
## effective tolerance is ~0.01-0.04m, far looser than 1e-4; the hardened
## assert below measures the actual distance and holds it to 1e-4.
##
## HARDENED (post-review): the original two-pair/one-crossing-each oracle
## was flagged as thin ("plausible, not proven" for crossings far from a
## polyline's natural resample-phase alignment — each chunk clips its OWN
## independently-phased resample of a differently-truncated polyline). This
## version scans every adjacent pair inside two VERIFIED wet clusters (all
## cardinal borders where water actually crosses), covering both pinned
## seeds, accumulating border crossings past the assert floor (total >= 6),
## most of them MID-ARC (>= 10m — measured range 45-330m — of curve inside
## BOTH chunks; also gated at >= 6 — see mid_arc_ct below, not a frozen
## count): crossings that deep into both sides' curves cannot be explained
## by endpoint/phase coincidence. Probe evidence (r3-task-3-report.md,
## Hardening section, 13 crossings/12 mid-arc at the time): all measured
## distances were 0.000000000 at 9 printed decimals — genuinely bit-equal,
## not merely inside 1e-4.
##
## Residual limitation, stated honestly: every real crossing on both pinned
## seeds sits on a locally STRAIGHT waterline reach (max nearby turn 0.0deg
## at all 13 — storey-quantized terrain crosses chunk borders along straight
## contour runs; rounded corner arcs are a few metres long and none coincide
## with a border line on these seeds). A crossing ON a curved arc — where
## the two sides' 1.5m chords could in principle disagree up to
## O(spacing^2 * curvature) — is therefore not exercised by any real site
## this suite can pin; if a future seed produces one, this oracle (explicit
## 1e-4 distance, no is_equal_approx slack) is what will catch it.
##
## The brief's literal chunk pair ((0,-47),(0,-46)) carries ZERO water on
## 2697992464 (verified: bodies_near on both chunks returns 0 ponds/0
## rivers) so it cannot exercise a weld at all; the clusters below are real,

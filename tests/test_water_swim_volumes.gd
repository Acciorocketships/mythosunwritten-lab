# RETIRED r3 Task 12b — see WaterSkin.STEEP_UNSWIMMABLE's own neighbouring
# docstring and r3-task-12b-report.md for the full proof): swim volumes are
# TRIGGER BOXES straight from WaterSkin's own `triggers` list — one per 24m
# wet TILE (footprint = union of every built vertex in that tile — see
# WaterSkin._triggers), no further splitting — each entry carrying
# set_meta("sampler", <the chunk's one frozen WaterSampler>) instead of a
# per-cell sampled plane (the old marching-squares mesher's per-cell swim
# data and the plane meta pair it produced are both deleted outright, r3
# Task 7). A probe anywhere inside a box reads its real water height
# straight from the sampler (WaterSampler.level_at), not from a linear
# extrapolation off one centre sample.
#
# This suite checks the SHAPE of that wiring: tile coverage, the top/bottom
# clearance arithmetic, sampler meta presence (a single shared instance per
# chunk), and level_at sanity against WaterField's own ground truth at real
# probe points. The STEEP-tile no-trigger gate and the site pins (I1 chute
# film / the historical "5.7" plunge pool centre) live in
# test_water_skin.gd (test_no_trigger_where_unswimmably_steep,
# test_legal_sloped_reach_keeps_its_trigger) per the task briefs. The full
# depth-CLASSIFICATION parity oracle (does a character's actual swim/wade/
# dry read ever disagree with the field?) is tests/test_water_classification.gd
# — deliberately not duplicated here.

## Task 7 review MEDIUM (shoreline-band coverage): the ~2m band of real,

## INSET-ed interior lattice must be answerable by the trigger's sampler —
## a character wading right at the water's edge stands exactly there, and a
## NaN answer makes character.gd's bridge read them as fully dry (neither
## swimming nor wading; the old per-cell sampled planes covered the whole
## cell, so this is a classification regression class, same render-vs-
## classification divergence family as run 2's I4). Probe points are built
## from WaterContour.curves' own points: p = pt - k*n̂ for k in 0.3..1.8
## (n̂ is the OUTWARD/dry-side unit normal per WaterContour's contract, so
## -n̂ steps into the water), filtered to points the FIELD itself calls wet
## (level - ground > 0.02, the same gate WaterSkin._lattice_wet uses) and
## whose 24m tile actually carries a trigger (a steep-gated tile has no box
## by design — no sampler is responsible there). Each surviving point must
## get a non-NaN sampler answer within 0.1 of WaterField.level_at.

## Task 7 live-gate follow-up (coordinator's "Defect A" oracle): the sampler
## must never report a level the FIELD does not itself report at the same
## (x,z) — pinned at the exact steep-face-adjacent points from the live
## evidence (the I1 chute at (53,-1083.9) and its neighbourhood down the
## 9.7 -> 5.7 cascade step). HONESTY NOTE (probe evidence, r3-task-7-report.md
## concern resolution 2): this oracle was NEVER red — the prescribed
## "sampler bleeds across steep faces" mechanism was unreproducible, because
## the sampler's corner values are point-samples of WaterField.level_at and
## its interpolation mirrors _fill_bilinear's own (guard-free since Phase 2a;
## the old FILL_JUMP constant no longer exists). Measured divergence at every
## probed chute point: 0.0000 — the 9.700 the live gate saw IS level_at's own
## answer there (the hydrostatic fill floods the face at the upstream level;
## wet()=true). The phantom-depth defect was therefore a TRIGGER-shape issue,
## historically fixed by the tile level-spread gate (see test_water_skin.gd::
## test_no_trigger_where_unswimmably_steep's site stanza); this test stays as
## the permanent guarantee that the sampler itself never ADDS divergence on
## top of the field near a chute.
## r3 Task 12b UPDATE: the trigger-shape suppression this note refers to
## (WaterSkin's level-spread gate) is now RETIRED — the phantom-depth class
## it existed to catch is dead by construction under the smooth monotone
## descent (r3-task-12b-report.md). This test's own guarantee (the sampler
## never diverges from the field) is now the PRIMARY anti-regression for
## phantom depth at the chute, not a secondary belt-and-braces check — see
## test_water_skin.gd::test_no_trigger_where_unswimmably_steep's own direct
## phantom-depth pin for the sibling assertion at the exact film point.

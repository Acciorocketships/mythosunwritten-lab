## GROUND FRAMES for the mass-first suites, in the plain
## `Dictionary[Vector2i -> int]` WarrenMassifBuilder.build actually takes.
##
## Synthetic terrain frames for the terrain-sensitive fabric suites. Flat
## ground is valid, but these tests also share one terraced hill so their
## relief, bearing, and route-grade assertions describe the same town.
##
## `hill()` is a compact adversarial terrace family for
## VillageWarrenFabricSolver._sample_ground_bands. Its dimensions exercise the
## same range as natural stepped terrain:
##
##   - relief under the footprint: 2-13 bands, mean 6;
##   - riser between adjacent terraces: 2-3 bands, i.e. the 4 m terrain storey
##     read through 1.5 m warren bands;
##   - bench width: 8-12 columns at the 3 m construction pitch.
##
## The fixture exists so a unit suite can exercise those shapes in milliseconds
## without standing up the terrain stack.

## One 4 m terrain storey read through 1.5 m warren bands, ceiled the way the
## production sampler ceils.

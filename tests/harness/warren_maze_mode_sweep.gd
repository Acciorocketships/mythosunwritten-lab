## The corpus sweep. Runs the real production entry point over a seed corpus

## composition ran and failed downstream.

##
## TASK F4 added the two big scales. They were unexercised by every sweep before
## it because the elevated-courtyard floor refused all 24 of them, so the matrix
## measured half the size profiles production actually rolls (~15 % of city
## seeds roll large or grand). The full 48-town matrix costs the wall clock
## printed in `SWEEP RESULT` and is what `test_corpus_composes` scores itself
## against.
##
## THE FULL MATRIX IS MANDATORY. An earlier version of this comment offered a
## "reduced large/grand seed list ... when the full one is unaffordable", which
## this harness cannot express and the corpus gate would not accept: `--seeds`
## is global to every scale, so there is no way to give large fewer seeds than
## compact, and `test_corpus_composes` asserts `rows.size() == seeds x scales`,
## which HARD-FAILS a short matrix rather than pending it. The capability was
## not built; the promise is withdrawn. `SWEEP RESULT per_scale` below states
## the shape that was actually measured — as evidence, not as a licence to
## measure less.
##
## Each row names the GATE the town died at -- the head of the solver's own
## failure -- so a corpus-wide run reads as a disposition of gates rather than a
## count of rejections. `--scale compact,standard,large,grand` runs every seed
## at each named profile instead of the one WarrenVillageScaleProfile.select()
## rolls for it, which is how the corpus matrix is measured.
##
## TASK F1 RULING 6. `--mode` and `--constructive` died with the searched
## pipeline: there is one path, so there is nothing to select. Passing either
## is an ERROR rather than a silent no-op, so stale muscle memory surfaces at
## the first run instead of in a matrix that measured something else.

## TASK C6 RULING 3. Where the corpus matrix is left for
## `tests/test_warren_maze_composition.gd::test_corpus_composes` to assert.
## The composition suite has a ~4 min budget and cannot afford 24 more
## production solves, so the sweep — which already runs them — writes the
## matrix down and the test reads it. Keep it under the ignored project cache:
## automated sandbox runs cannot write the user's global Godot data directory,
## while `res://.godot` remains machine-local and travels with this checkout's
## exact source fingerprint.

## evidence about the code that produced it, so it carries a fingerprint of
## every script in the village fabric layer and the test refuses a summary
## whose fingerprint no longer matches the tree it is running against. The
## whole directory rather than a hand-kept list of files: a list is a thing
## that goes stale silently, and a stale list is exactly the failure mode this
## fingerprint exists to prevent.

## TASK I4 ROUND 2 -- AND A BAKE EDIT IS A CODE EDIT, as far as this matrix is
## concerned. The clearance row is the one column here that asks the real physics
## server, so what it measures is the BAKED COLLIDERS, and those are authored in
## this directory: an edit to `market_stall_006_007.tscn` moves the hull the
## siting gate keeps clear for a market stall without touching one line of the
## fabric layer. Before this it left the recorded matrix looking fresh.
##
## The AUTHORED SOURCES rather than the baked `.res` shapes, deliberately: the
## sources are the hand-edited, git-tracked input a person actually changes, and
## the bake is a pure function of them plus the manifest. A re-bake that produced
## different colliders from unchanged sources would still slip through -- named
## in the report, not fixed here, because catching it means fingerprinting 630
## generated files to guard a step nobody performs by hand.

## The most cell boundaries any ONE town may shut. MEASURED, not designed: the
## corpus shuts some, and pretending otherwise would mean pinning a zero that
## has never been true. The shard's lobe stands 0.155-0.595 m proud of its
## boundary and where two of them meet across a crossing, or one wide one lies
## along it, a body cannot pass -- exactly the risk task H2c's report raised as
## its first concern and could only measure on four towns by hand. Per TOWN
## rather than per corpus so the number means the same thing whatever seed set
## a sweep is given. A RISE means the skin has pinched more streets than it did
## and wants looking at. The number is the worst town of the 48-town matrix
## (12 seeds x compact,standard,large,grand) and it is now ZERO: after task H2c
## fix round 1 not one crossing in the corpus is shut. It was 18 on 9/grand
## against 139 shut crossings before the rock cut, and 2 against 4 before the
## coursed trim that followed it.
##
## `splits` and `cells_unreachable` are pinned at ZERO beside it, and those two
## ARE the serious pins: a shut crossing with a way round narrows a street, a
## shut crossing without one breaks it.
##
## ALL FOUR PINS ARE GREEN AND MEASURED, which is the state task H2c fix round 1
## left. Getting here took two passes over the same defect in two materials:
## `SettlementFabricAssembler`'s ROCK CUT took the corpus from 43 split route
## components and 988 stranded walked cells to 2 and 16, and the COURSED TRIM
## that followed took the last two towns to zero. Both are the same mechanism --
## a module taller than the band it clads, hanging into a street that runs under
## it -- so if a future skin module is introduced with the same habit, look here
## first.
##
## A red here is therefore a REGRESSION, not a known debt. The matrix summary is
## written before any exit, so the corpus gate reads its matrix either way.
##
## TASK I1: 0 -> 2 AND BACK TO 0, AND THE ROUND TRIP IS THE RECORD WORTH
## KEEPING. The halved footprints put three walked cells of the 45 sealed towns
## under a skin module that stands in them — `3/compact` (-5,3,-2), `6/grand`
## (-1,4,6) and `10/grand` (3,2,8), four shut crossings between them — and task
## I1's first landing PINNED that at 2 instead of fixing it.
##
## Fix round 1 named the mechanism and closed it. It is not the shard's lobe
## this file's note above suspected: it is an UNPAIRED CAP, the same 3 m masonry
## module laid FLAT over a 1.5 m cell, reaching 0.75 m past the run it closes
## and into the street beside it — 0.750 m left of a 1.5 m cell against a
## 0.795 m body, so the capsule fits nowhere. The skin's own trim machinery now
## covers that third axis (`SettlementFabricAssembler
## .maze_stone_cap_juts_over_walk`), and the 48-town matrix measures ZERO
## blocked cells, ZERO shut crossings, ZERO splits and ZERO unreachable cells.
## `CLEARANCE_BLOCKED_CELL_CEILING`, which existed for exactly one matrix run,
## is gone with the defect it recorded.
##
## Pinned at the measured worst town rather than at the corpus total, for the
## reason the offset ceilings below are: a per-corpus number means one thing on
## this matrix and another on a spot check. ONE shut crossing anywhere is red.
const CLEARANCE_TOWN_GATE_CEILING := 0
## TASK H2c FIX 2, MINOR 5. THE TWO COSTS, PINNED -- because a collapse has to
## be visible in reverse. The rock cut took `offset_free` from 1096 walked cells
## (12.57 %) to 69 (0.79 %) and `gates_offset` from 877 crossings (7.10 %) to
## 147 (1.19 %), and until now those were REPORTED and nothing more: revert the
## cut and both numbers walk back up in silence while every pin stays green,
## because the pins below them only count what is fully shut.
##
## Per TOWN and not per corpus, for the same reason the gate ceiling above is:
## a corpus total means one thing on the 48-town matrix and something else on
## any other seed set, and a pin that fires on a spot check is a pin people
## learn to ignore. The two numbers are the WORST TOWN of that matrix -- 9/grand
## both times, 9 cells and 15 crossings -- and the corpus they roll up to is 69
## and 147, printed on the result line beside them.
##
## These are COSTS, not damage. A cell counted here still admits a body and a
## crossing counted here can still be walked; what they say is that the shard's
## lobe is in the way of the exact centreline. A rise means the skin leans into
## more streets than it did, which is worth a look and is not by itself a bug.
##
## TASK I2 TAKES BOTH TO ZERO, and it is the shard leaving that does it. The
## 48-town matrix on the shipped tree measures `offset_free = 0` of 9152 walked
## cells and `gates_offset = 0` of 13042 crossings, against 69 and 147 at task
## I1's baseline: every walked cell in the corpus now admits a body on its exact
## centreline. The mechanism is one line of `_maze_facade_transform` -- a facade
## panel is pinned by its OUTER face to the boundary and stands 0.000 m into the
## cell it faces, where the shard stood 0.375 m plus its relief -- and the
## panels it replaced are 58 % of every exposed vertical face in the corpus.
##
## THE MARGIN THAT IS LEFT IS 1.2 MILLIMETRES, and a reader who sees this row go
## red should look here before anywhere else. What still straddles a boundary is
## the coursed retaining course: the module is 0.66389 m deep and centred, so two
## of them facing each other across a one-cell street leave
## 1.5 - 2 x 0.33194 = 0.83612 m against a capsule that needs
## 0.79492 + 2 x 0.02 = 0.83492 m. It fits by 0.00120 m. Nothing in the corpus
## is tighter and nothing in the corpus fails, but a re-bake that deepened
## `sfv.fabric.wall.rock.plain.001` by a centimetre would put this row red
## without any code changing -- and that is the tripwire firing correctly, not a
## false alarm. The fix THEN is the trim machinery this file already documents,
## applied to the coursed panel's depth rather than its height.

## The skywalk channel's corpus ratchet. Clearance proves the streets remain
## passable; this separately proves the algorithm still finds real overhead
## connections. It is measured output, never a generation quota. One connection
## is either a canonical open bridge span OR one occupied two-ended bridge-house:
## they are alternative presentations of the same topological feature, so a
## ratchet that counted only the open form would report a regression when the
## stronger inhabited form replaced it.
##
## The final 2026-08-30 matrix follows both the construction-by-contract revision
## and Task I8's source-footprint reduction from 7/8/9/11 to 5/6/7/8 cells. An
## open span must join the reachable exterior network, while an occupied span is
## one atomic bridge room plus two endpoint/foundation compounds and semantic
## party roofs. Former candidates whose roofs, endpoints, or supports floated are
## deliberately absent rather than preserved as decoration. The new 48-attempt
## matrix seals 20 compact/standard towns with 5 open connections and 19
## large/grand towns with 2 open + 5 occupied connections. It retains zero
## blocked cells and gates across 7,668 public cells and 10,888 route gates.
## Fewer source columns create fewer valid same-band, two-ended crossing sites;
## this ratchet was therefore remeasured with the footprint instead of preserving
## a count measured on towns the user explicitly rejected as too large. Output

## TASK I4 ROUND 8. How finely the pin grid samples a walked cell's plan when it

## every 75 mm, which resolves an eave's edge an order finer than the 0.25 m the
## burial rules call a burial and costs 441 shape queries per pinch on the 0.4
## pinches per town this matrix really has.
const PINCH_INTRUSION_STEPS := 21
## How far a collider over a street may reach TOWARDS THAT STREET'S CENTRELINE
## before it stops being an eave and starts being a wall.
##
## DERIVED, NOT CHOSEN, and the derivation is the whole claim -- but it is the
## derivation the measurement below really makes, which is not the one this
## constant carried until the r7+r8 review read it (B1). `intrusion` is
## `half - nearest`, where `half` is HALF A CELL and `nearest` is the RADIAL
## distance from the cell's centre to the closest occupied pin sample. A body
## standing on the centreline claims `NATURAL_ROCK_CUT_BODY_WIDTH * 0.5` around
## it, so it goes untouched exactly while
##
##     nearest > body_half
##       <=>  CELL_SIZE * 0.5 - intrusion > body_half
##       <=>  intrusion < CELL_SIZE * 0.5 - body_half
##
## -- 0.750 - 0.397 = 0.35254 m. NOT `body_half` itself (0.39746 m), which is
## what this said and enforced. The two are close only because a 1.5 m cell is
## nearly twice a 0.795 m body; they would be equal at `CELL_SIZE = 1.59`. As
## written the old ceiling admitted a hull reaching 0.045 m INSIDE the radius of
## the body it claimed to protect, so the generalisation -- the half of the
## exception meant to hold for towns nobody has rendered -- did not hold.
##
## AND `intrusion` IS RADIAL, which is not "how far in from the edge" in the
## per-edge sense that wording invites (minor 1). For the 0.346 m cases the hull
## occupies two corner squares roughly 0.46 m deep measured square from each of
## the two edges it brushes; 0.346 m is its shortest line to the CENTRE, which
## is the quantity the body question asks and the only one this ceiling rules.
##
## Measured on the 18 cases round 8 determined: 0.346 m for the two
## `lpfv.fabric.roof.compact.*` eaves, 0.294 m for `sfv.fabric.roof.window.002`
## and 0.220 m for `.004`. Against the corrected ceiling the worst of them keeps
## **0.0065 m** -- six and a half millimetres, not the 51 mm round 8 published.
## The exception stands, because what it rests on is unmoved: `centre_blocked`
## and `gates_blocked` are direct capsule queries and both are zero matrix-wide.
## What changes is that the tripwire is now genuinely tight, which is the point
## of having one: a rise here means a roof has started oversailing streets
## instead of clipping their corners, and there is almost no room left before
## one does.
##
## The pin grid over-reports vertically -- it sinks a 0.02 m column through the
## whole body height while a capsule tapers away through its top hemisphere --
## which is why a hull at radial 0.404 m does not trip a 0.397 m capsule. That
## slack is in the safe direction and none of it is spent here.

	## TASK I4 ROUND 8, PART 3 -- WHY THE SQUARE HAS NO ENTRANCE, as a number
	## instead of an argument.
	##
	## `maze_plaza_entries` calls a garden cell ENTERED when a walked cell stands
	## one band up and one cell across, because that is where the two surfaces are
	## level to the millimetre: garden ground is the TOP of its cell, a walked
	## floor
	## is the BOTTOM of its own. On 15 of 24 compact and standard towns NO garden
	## run is entered anywhere, the designation falls through to `largest`, and the
	## town keeps a green nobody can walk onto. Rounds 6 and 7 both tried to move
	## that from the plot layer and both failed honestly; round 8 was ruled to try
	## the fabric side and needs to know what the fabric side is even looking at.
	##
	## SO EVERY RUN IS CLASSIFIED BY ITS DISTANCE FROM A STREET, in bands, and the
	## FOUR CLASSES ARE A PARTITION -- which is the r7+r8 review's I1 and the
	## reason this list has four entries instead of three. Round 8 printed
	## `entered`, `stepped` and `isolated`, a reader took them for the whole of the
	## population, and they summed to 162 of 179 runs: the 17 runs sitting TWO or
	## THREE bands from a street fell through both tests and were counted nowhere.
	##
	## * ENTERED -- a street meets it at grade. Nothing to fix.
	## * STEPPED -- no street at grade, but one stands one band off a lateral
	##   neighbour: a 1.5 m rise, which is three times `TraversalEnvelope.
	##   MAX_FINISHED_STEP` and therefore wants a STAIR rather than a step. The
	##   stair vocabulary exists (`SettlementFabricProgram.STAIR_HALF` rises
	##   exactly
	##   one band) but it is a PLOT recipe placed into a reserved stair void and
	##   turned into a walk surface by `PublicRealmSurfaceSolver` -- so the fabric
	##   layer, which compiles against a surface plan that is already sealed,
	##   cannot
	##   put a walkable one there. This count is the size of the prize a plot-layer
	##   round would be playing for.
	## * NEAR -- no street at grade and none one band off, but one within
	##   GREEN_REACH_BANDS: two or three bands, 3.0 to 4.5 m of climb, two
	##   switchback flights. Whether that is worth building is a design call this
	##   row does not make -- but it is emphatically not "nothing reaches these",
	##   and the towns whose only green sits here are named on the row so the
	##   question can be asked about them by name.
	## * ISOLATED -- no street within GREEN_REACH_BANDS of any of its edges, up or
	##   down. Nothing joins these to the town at all, and they are the honest
	##   view-gardens: 7 of 7/large's 8 runs, 81 of its 87 garden cells.
	##
	## THE TOWN CLASSES ARE THE SAME PARTITION, ONE LEVEL UP, and round 8's
	## `towns_isolated` was not: it counted `entered == 0 and stepped == 0`, which
	## is "no green a street meets and none one band off" -- and the report read it
	## out as "no street within three bands", which was wrong for 8 of the 17.
	## `towns_near_only` is those 8, and `towns_all_isolated` is what the old name
	## claimed to be.

	## massif's skin, the green rim walls, the garden dressing with the plaza's
	## thresholds and centre feature in it, the terrace railings (since task
	## C5e), and task I3's skywalks and facade outcroppings. It is therefore the
	## town's whole FABRIC DRESSING -- which is what the row now prints -- and
	## not the `skin_only` it claimed for three tasks after that stopped being
	## true. What it still excludes is the BUILDINGS: no room shells, no doors,
	## no props. So it remains an isolation rather than a walkability guarantee
	## for a finished town, and it is now an honest one: every collider it
	## commits is one the retained crown really carries, including the bearers a
	## bridge or a bay hangs over a street.
	##
	## THREE MEASUREMENTS, because a per-cell fit is not walkability:
	##
	## * `centre_free` -- a body stands on the cell's own centreline;
	## * `offset_free` -- it fits somewhere inside the cell but not there, which
	##   is the honest cost of giving the shard a collider (the body walks round
	##   the lobe) and is REPORTED rather than pinned;
	## * `gates_blocked` -- NO point along the boundary between two adjacent
	##   walked cells admits a body. This is the one that turns per-cell fit
	##   into passage: two cells can each be free at some offset while the
	##   doorway between them is shut, and that street is still shut.
	##
	## The gate is swept along its own width rather than probed at its midpoint
	## alone, because the midpoint alone repeats exactly the mistake the cell
	## centreline makes. The shard's lobe covers 0.53-0.70 m of a 1.5 m boundary,
	## so a midpoint-only test called 194 of 2439 gates shut over the eight-town
	## run this was validated on, when a body walks through 187 of those 194 a
	## handspan to one side; `gates_offset` is that population, reported, and
	## `gates_blocked` is what is genuinely left.
	##
	## AND THEN THE ROUTE GRAPH, because a shut crossing is not yet a broken
	## street. Two cells with another way round are NARROWED; two cells without
	## one are CUT APART, and only the second is a bug a player would ever meet.
	## `gates_blocked_required` counts the shut crossings that turned out to be
	## load-bearing, `splits` counts the route components that fell apart, and
	## `cells_unreachable` counts the cells left stranded. The last two are the

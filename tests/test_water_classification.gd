# CLASSIFICATION PARITY (r3 Task 9's own deliverable): does the character's
# ACTUAL swim/wade/dry read — replicated here, test-side, as a geometric
# trigger-rect + WaterSampler query rather than a live PhysicsServer point
# query (deterministic, no scene/physics setup needed; every trigger rect
# this codebase builds is a plain axis-aligned box, exactly what
# Area3D.BoxShape3D + intersect_point would report — see
# test_water_swim_volumes.gd's own established pattern of probing trigger
# geometry directly) — ever disagree with FIELD TRUTH (WaterField.level_at
# minus ground, the naive "how deep is the water here" question, thresholded
# the same way character.gd's own ENTER gates are (0.8 swim, 0.05 wade; no
# hysteresis/previous-state modelled here — a cold, single-shot snapshot has
# no "previous frame" to hold a hysteresis band open, so ENTER is the only
# meaningful threshold for a oneshot classification)?
#
# ALL SIX classes (deep interior, waterline band, dry bank, steep chute,
# plunge pool centre, sloped-reach mid-channel) are real parity: field truth
# and character-math must read the IDENTICAL class at every probed point,
# zero mismatches. Historically (r3 Task 7/9) the steep-chute class was the
# ONE deliberate exception — a level-SPREAD suppression mechanism forced
# character-math to read DRY over a field-claimed depth, because the OLD
# stepped profile model's flat upstream shelves really could stand phantom
# depth over a downstream face. r3 Task 12/12a's smooth monotone descent
# removed the flat shelves that phantom class depended on; r3 Task 12b
# proved the suppression mechanism dead by construction on this site and
# deleted it outright (see WaterSkin.STEEP_UNSWIMMABLE's own neighbouring
# docstring and r3-task-12b-report.md) — test_steep_chute below is now
# ordinary parity too, see its own docstring for the measured before/after.
#
# Pinned review seed/chunk — the site chunk carries the R3 cascade this task
# reconciles (see WaterSkin.gd's own TRIGGER_LEVEL_SPREAD_MAX docstring and
# r3-task-9-report.md).

## --- Class 4: steep chute (HISTORICALLY the one INTENTIONAL divergence
## class — RECONCILED r3 Task 12b) ---
## Candidates come from FIELD/GEOMETRY data ONLY — pinned chute coordinates
## plus a field-static-depth filter — never from skin.triggers. (Review fix,
## r3 Task 9: the first version pre-filtered candidates through
## _any_trigger_covers, whose rect.has_point is the IDENTICAL predicate
## _character_class's own first gate applies — "0 offenders" was true by
## construction, a tautology that could never fail. Keeping candidate
## selection FIELD-only, never trigger-gated, is what keeps THIS version
## falsifiable too, see below.)
##
## The point set walks the I1 chute face itself: x in [44, 58], z in
## {-1083, -1084, -1085} — the cascade-step band where, under the OLD
## stepped profile model, the hydrostatic fill stood the 9.7 reach's flat
## level over sloping ground (the owner's I1 "a waterfall stands where the
## terrain has only slopes"; film point (53, -1083.9) pinned live at static
## depth ~2.5 over a ~0.3m film) — filtered to points the FIELD itself
## claims wet at static depth > 0.5.
##
## r3 Task 12b RECONCILIATION: this class's old premise — that character-
## math must deliberately DIVERGE from field truth here (reading DRY over a
## field-claimed depth) — was true only because the OLD model's flat
## upstream shelf made the field's own reading a lie (phantom depth over a
## real thin film). r3 Task 12/12a's smooth monotone descent removes that
## lie structurally: this span has ZERO interior sill knots
## (r3-task-12a-report.md), so there is no flat shelf anywhere along it, and
## the Task-7/9 level-SPREAD suppression that used to force the divergence
## is RETIRED (r3-task-12b-report.md's own proof — see WaterSkin.
## STEEP_UNSWIMMABLE's neighbouring docstring). Measured directly on this
## EXACT 87-point candidate set: character-math (the real trigger+sampler
## path) and field truth now agree at EVERY point — 29 read SWIM, 58 read
## WADE, 0 DRY, on BOTH sides, 0 mismatches. The assertion is therefore full
## PARITY (the same oracle every other class in this file uses), not "must
## read DRY" — asserting DRY here would now assert a MEASURED FALSEHOOD (29
## of these 87 points are genuinely, honestly >0.8m deep: small pool-like
## pockets the smooth ramp legitimately carries partway down the descent,
## not a suppressed phantom).
##
## FALSIFIABILITY (without the old TRIGGER_SUB_TILE_SPREAD_MAX=999
## induced-red mechanism, whose constant no longer exists to bump):
## candidates are selected from FIELD data alone, never through
## skin.triggers — so if a future regression left this band un-triggered
## (the OLD, correct-for-its-time behaviour), every candidate would read DRY
## against a SWIM/WADE truth and this test would fail loudly, exactly as it
## would have caught the opposite direction before r3 Task 12.

# Task 12b found (report): with DESCENT_CLAMP==EPS==0.05, a point the envelope
# pins to `ground + DESCENT_CLAMP` reads `level - ground == EPS` EXACTLY — not
# strictly greater — so the fill DRIES the very band the envelope shaped to
# keep wet (reproduced at the far pond chunk (-4,-18)'s sill knot
# (-606.135,-3432.959): curve 4.0320, ground 3.9820, depth 0.0500 == EPS). The
# fix is a UNIFORM floor lift, NOT a knot-local margin: an earlier 12b cut
# added the margin only at ground-DERIVED knot assignments, which raised a

# left unhealed free edges at the pond (test_skin_handles_closed_and_border_
# exit_curves went red). Lifting the WHOLE floor together keeps the sill-ride

# EPS, wet) with the mesh still watertight. Dormant on the pinned SITE_CHUNK
# (its chute resolves to zero interior knots, r3-task-12a-report.md) — a

# UNDER the very floor it had just been pinned to (measured at the site: the

## Hydrostatic fill over a (FILL_M+1)x(FILL_M+1) lattice at FILL_STEP anchored

##  1. SEED: every lattice sample within a channel sample's width (river) or a
##     pond's wobbled footprint is marked wet at that body's own level — the
##     trace's own profile.levels[si] per sample (the brief's literal rule),
##     pond.surface_y() for ponds. A sample within two overlapping seed discs
##     at different levels is offered both; relaxation's ascending pop order
##     resolves it to the lower one (see _settle).
##  2. RELAX: multi-source flood by ASCENDING level (a min-heap keyed on
##     level — see the PriorityQueue import below). A dry sample floods to
##     level L the first time it is 4-adjacent to a sample already settled at
##     L, provided the sample's own ground sits below L - EPS. Settling
##     lowest-pending-level-first is what makes the result independent of
##     seed/traversal order (see FILL_MARGIN's comment): within one level,
##     reachability through "ground < L - EPS" is a fixed subgraph, so a
##     sample either is or isn't reachable at that level regardless of visit
##     order; across levels, once a sample is settled at its lowest possible
##     level no higher level may ever re-claim it (lower always wins), which

##     distance and same-level propagation standing in for zero-cost edges.

## Continuous, monotone level per trace sample. NO cuts array (Phase 2a):

## across one 12m segment is now terrain-aware instead of an instant jump —
## see _descend_segment. Where the rendered ground (TerrainSurfaceField,
## sampled every _DESCENT_STEP along the segment) stays well clear of a
## smooth (gentle-slope) interpolation between the two anchors, the level
## just rides that smooth trend (ordinary continuous-reach behaviour,
## unchanged in spirit from before). Where the ground rises close to or
## above the smooth trend — a genuine cliff — the level instead hugs
## ground + FILM, descending steeply along the face; the two curves are
## soft-blended near their crossover (_EASE_BAND) so the exposed profile has
## no slope kink (the brief's "C1 easing... 1D ogee"). Falls are now a
## PROFILE SHAPE, not a cut object: a "fall" is just the stretch of this one
## continuous curve where hugging dominates. steep_spans() (below) reports
## WHERE that happens, purely for shader/mist consumers — nothing here
## forks the geometry.
## region is optional: hand-built test traces / callers with no terrain
## field (e.g. test_multi_seam_cell_never_folds' synthetic st, or a unit
## trace with no HeightfieldRegion) fall back to the OLD instant bed-chase
## (lvl = min(lvl, raw_i) with no terrain walk) — there is no ground to hug,
## so the only sound behaviour is the plain monotone chase. Every real
## production caller (ctx() with a region, WaterSkin.build) always passes
## one.
##
## C1 fix (final-review-run2.md Critical 1): a `region` that carries a real
## `plan` back-pointer (built by HeightfieldPlan.compute_region — see
## HeightfieldRegion.plan's own docstring; hand-built test fixtures that
## construct a HeightfieldRegion directly leave `plan` null) is traded here
## for a TRACE-OWNED canonical region from that SAME plan (_trace_owned_
## region), sized to the trace's own bbox rather than any caller's chunk
## window. This is what makes profile() a pure function of (trace, plan)
## again: every plan-backed caller for a given source_cell ends up shaping
## the descent against the exact same ground data regardless of which
## chunk/region reached this function first — the bug this fixes (see the
## final review) was exactly that the FIRST caller's chunk-scoped region won
## and poisoned the cache for every later caller, including ones whose own
## region would have been accurate. A region with no plan (or no region at
## all) keeps the OLD region-identity behaviour unchanged — see the
## region-optional note above; those callers have no plan to build a

## _DESCENT_STEP-spaced substep along the segment:
##   - smooth(t): a gentle, smootherstep-eased interpolation from start_lvl
##     to end_target — the ordinary "continuous reach" trend, identical in
##     spirit to the old lvl = min(lvl, raw_i) instant chase but spread
##     across the whole segment instead of applied at the endpoint alone.
##   - ground_hug(t): TerrainSurfaceField.surface_y(region, ...) + FILM — the
##     lowest the level may physically sit at that point (can't run through
##     rock).
## The exposed level is whichever is HIGHER, but blended smoothly near their
## crossover (soft-max via smootherstep over _EASE_BAND of level-gap,
## instead of a hard max()) so the profile's slope has no kink where hugging
## takes over or lets go — the substep-granularity stand-in for the brief's
## "C1 easing over ~2m at the top and bottom of any steep stretch (1D
## ogee)": a literal along-channel arc-length ease window is awkward at
## _DESCENT_STEP's substep granularity (there is no continuous parametric
## curve to measure "2m in" against, only discrete samples), so the ease is
## driven by the LEVEL GAP between the two curves instead — same qualitative
## effect (a soft S-shaped blend, not a hard corner) and it degrades
## gracefully as substeps coarsen or the crossover falls between two
## samples. A final min() against the previous substep's own held value
## keeps the whole curve monotone non-increasing even if the ground (and so
## ground_hug) bumps back up mid-segment — smooth(t) alone is already
## monotone by construction, but the blend with ground_hug is not
## guaranteed to be.
## On gentle terrain (the pinned site, per H1: this trace's surface_y never
## drops more than 4.0m in ANY 24m window) ground_hug stays well below
## smooth(t) for the whole segment, so the level just rides the smooth
## trend end to end — ordinary continuous-reach behaviour, unchanged from
## before in outcome (only in mechanism).
##
## r3 Task 12 (round-4 addendum): this per-SEGMENT hug is now used only for
## segments OUTSIDE a descent span (see _find_descent_spans/
## _shape_descent_span, both called from profile()) — ordinary reaches,
## exactly the "gentle terrain" case this docstring already describes, where
## end_target never moves far from start_lvl and hugging essentially never
## engages. Segments INSIDE a span are shaped by _shape_descent_span instead:
## chasing each segment's own LOCAL end_target (as this function does) is
## exactly the behaviour the owner rejected for a real multi-segment
## descent — end_target itself follows the storey-quantized bed sample by
## sample, so even a perfectly-smooth per-segment ease reproduces a
## staircase across several segments (smootherstep's own zero-slope
## endpoints reset the curve flat at every trace sample). This function's

## function of arc length between the two anchors and the ground it must
## clear — ground is never the shaping signal for the DROP itself, only for

## resolution — the granularity the brief's own smoothness oracle measures,

## Two steps:
##  1. _find_descent_knots discovers the knot set: the two anchors, plus

##     — iterated to a fixpoint (a knot can shift where the NEXT under-run is
##     found, but never removes a knot, so the search only ever adds; see
##     that function's own docstring for the termination argument).
##  2. _eval_descent_knots fits ONE monotone cubic Hermite spline (Fritsch-
##     Carlson tangents) through every knot — provably monotone and C1 by
##     construction (see that function's own docstring for the proof) — and
##     NOTHING runs afterward to disturb the fit. The knots themselves are

## exactly (both are the first/last knot by construction — see

## terrain sampled at each — see _dense_span_curve). Starts from JUST the two
## span anchors (k=0 -> anchor_start, k=steps -> anchor_end) and repeatedly:
##  1. evaluates the monotone curve through the CURRENT knot set
##     (_eval_descent_knots);
##  2. scans for maximal runs of dense indices where that curve under-runs
##     ground + DESCENT_CLAMP (a 1e-4 slack absorbs float noise at an exact
##     touch);
##  3. for each such run, inserts ONE new knot at the run's own highest
##     `ground + DESCENT_CLAMP` point — the single point most likely to pull
##     the WHOLE run clear in one shot (it is at least as tall as every
##     other point in the run), a fast-convergence heuristic, not a hard
##     per-insertion guarantee: inserting an interior knot can shift its
##     NEIGHBOURS' own Fritsch-Carlson tangents too (see
##     _descent_knot_tangents), so correctness does not rest on any single
##     insertion clearing its run — it rests on the OUTER loop, which
##     re-scans the FRESH curve (step 1, above) against EVERY dense index
##     again next pass and keeps adding knots until a full scan finds zero
##     violations;
## and repeats until that fixpoint (a pass adds no knot). TERMINATION: knots
## are only ever ADDED, never removed or moved, and there are at most
## `steps - 1` interior dense indices that could ever become one (each index
## becomes a knot at most once — see the `is_knot` guard below) — so the
## outer loop runs at most `steps - 1` times even in the worst case
## (`guard`'s own budget is one wider, `steps + 2`, purely so an off-by-one
## in this argument fails LOUD, as an assert-shaped print, rather than
## silently under-iterating); empirically (this task's report) real spans
## converge in a single pass.
## A new knot's value is `ground + DESCENT_CLAMP` at its own point, CLAMPED
## into [next-knot's value, previous-knot's value] before insertion — the
## span's upstream/downstream neighbours in the knot list at the moment of
## insertion, which by induction already bracket every value in between
## (base case: the two anchors bracket everything, by profile()'s own
## monotone chase; inductive step: a new knot is only ever inserted STRICTLY
## between two existing knots and clamped to their own values). This is what
## keeps the KNOT VALUES themselves monotone non-increasing by construction —
## the property _eval_descent_knots' own monotonicity proof depends on —
## without needing to trust that `ground + DESCENT_CLAMP` itself happens to
## be monotone (it isn't; the terrain is storey-jagged).

## PROOF OF C1: cubic Hermite basis functions are C1 by construction WHEN
## consecutive segments agree on the tangent at their shared knot — which

## PROOF OF MONOTONICITY (Fritsch-Carlson's own sufficient condition): a
## cubic Hermite segment with secant slope Δ=(y1-y0)/h and endpoint tangents
## (m0,m1) is monotone on [0,1] whenever m0/Δ and m1/Δ both lie in [0,3].
## _descent_knot_tangents guarantees this for EVERY segment: an interior
## tangent m_i is either exactly 0 (always safe — (0, anything in [0,3]) is
## inside the FC region) or shares the sign of both flanking secants
## delta[i-1]/delta[i] (the sign-disagreement branch already zeroed it
## otherwise) with |m_i| <= 3*min(|delta[i-1]|, |delta[i]|) <= 3*|delta[i-1]|
## AND <= 3*|delta[i]| simultaneously (a min is <= either operand) — exactly
## m_i/delta[i-1] and m_i/delta[i] both in [0,3]. The two OUTER tangents are
## pinned to 0, trivially in-range against their own single flanking Δ. Knot
## VALUES are monotone non-increasing by construction (see

## r3 Task 12a: one Fritsch-Carlson tangent per knot (see _eval_descent_knots
## for the monotonicity proof this feeds). `delta[i]` is the secant slope of
## segment i (knot i to knot i+1), in value-per-dense-INDEX units (uniform
## _DESCENT_STEP spacing, so this is the true slope up to a constant global
## scale — the Hermite evaluator multiplies back by the segment's own `h`,
## so the scale cancels exactly). Both outer tangents are 0 (the span's two
## anchors are flat pools — C1 with the water either side of this span, same
## contract the round-4 version's smootherstep ease already guaranteed).
## Every interior tangent is either 0 (at a local extremum in the KNOT
## sequence — one flanking secant flat, or the two disagreeing in sign; a
## flat secant is reachable in practice, e.g. two adjacent knots clamped to
## the same value, and is always safe to zero — see _eval_descent_knots' own
## proof for why (0, anything in [0,3]) is always inside the monotone
## region; a sign DISAGREEMENT cannot actually occur here since knot values
## are monotone non-increasing by construction, so every delta is already
## <= 0, but the guard is kept for robustness/reuse) or the average of its
## two flanking secants, magnitude-limited to 3x the SMALLER of their

## Surface height at p, or -INF when the water can't be shown to reach p.

##  - ctx carries a fill (built by ctx() when region != null) AND p sits
##    inside the fill window: BILINEAR over the fill lattice — see
##    _fill_bilinear. This is the hydrostatic answer: reachable-by-relaxation
##    water at its own settled level, -INF everywhere the fill left dry.
##  - No fill available (ctx built without region — a few pre-existing
##    tests/callers still do this) OR p falls outside the fill window (the
##    fill only covers chunk+FILL_MARGIN — see FILL_MARGIN's comment): fall
##    back to CHANNEL-MEMBERSHIP ONLY, i.e. exactly the old nearest-claimant
##    search but with NO flood/margin competition — a point claims water
##    when it is within a channel sample's width or a pond's footprint, OR

##    literal m < 0 — see _channel_membership_level's own margin math and
##    Minor 4, final-review-run2.md), smallest-margin wins among those. This

## Bilinear over the fill lattice. A mixed wet/dry cell is interpreted as a
## signed-depth field: wet corners keep their exact settled surface, while a
## dry corner contributes `ground + EPS - SHORE_DRY_DEPTH` (capped at the
## wet-only interpolant so a high bank can never pull water uphill). The
## result tapers through zero depth inside the cell instead of holding the
## wet value to a hard 6m lattice edge. This is the field-level source of
## the blob-like shoreline: contour smoothing receives a real depth crossing
## rather than an axis-aligned claim boundary. A 3m cell touching an actual
## topology rescue applies this same rule through `_fill_bilinear_sub`; every
## untouched sample remains the original 6m answer. -INF remains the answer
## when the query has zero weighted contact with any wet corner.
##
## Phase 1's FILL_JUMP snap (superseded, Phase 2a): an earlier version of
## this function ALSO snapped to the nearest corner instead of blending
## whenever two WET corners' levels differed by more than a fixed 2.0m
## (FILL_JUMP), reasoning that two adjacent lattice nodes far apart in level
## must be different, unrelated water bodies (a real storey wall) rather
## than one continuous slope — correct for Phase 1, where profile() could
## only ever put a HARD CUT between two samples (so two nearby fill-lattice
## nodes on truly different levels really were disjoint pieces). Phase 2a
## deletes that premise: profile() now shapes a genuinely continuous,
## monotone descent even across what used to be a fall cut (see profile()/
## _descend_segment), so two adjacent WET fill-lattice nodes at very
## different levels are now routinely a LEGITIMATE steep fall face, not a
## different body — snapping them would chop a real continuous drop into a
## blocky step. The Phase 1 follow-up comment that used to live here (the
## "zero slack, not a margin" derivation showing the steepest legal Phase-1
## river slope landed EXACTLY at the old FILL_JUMP=2.0 threshold) is
## superseded along with the guard it was documenting — that derivation was
## about protecting a hard-cut boundary that no longer exists. Two adjacent
## wet nodes can still legitimately belong to different, disconnected
## bodies (e.g. two lakes split by a real, dry ridge) — but the fill's own
## ground-clearance gate (_relax_fill) already guarantees a dry ridge
## between them shows up as an actually-DRY lattice node in between, which
## the wet/dry renormalization above already handles correctly; there is no
## longer a case where two WET-WET neighbours need special-casing.

## Steep terrain stretches along every river channel in c, whose LIP (`p`) OR
## BASE (`base_p`) lies inside rect (grown by one tile so chunk-border spans
## appear for both neighbouring chunks — Minor 5, final-review-run2.md:
## lip-only gating dropped a span whose base sits in this chunk but whose lip
## lies >TILE outside the rect, leaving the plunge-churn band baked into one
## chunk and not its neighbour, a CUSTOM0 seam at the border for any steep
## stretch taller than the lip-to-base horizontal run) — the terrain-scan
## replacement for the old bed-cut-derived fall_cuts (Phase 2a: falls are a
## PROFILE SHAPE now, not a cut object; this feeds ONLY the shader churn band
## and (later) mist, never geometry — see the file header and profile()'s own
## docstring). Each
## entry: {p: Vector2 (lip position), dir (unit, downstream), across (unit,
## perpendicular), half (channel half-width + CLAIM_FEATHER at the lip),
## top: WATER level at the lip, bottom: WATER level at the base, drop: the
## GROUND drop _steep_scan measured}. top/bottom are profile() levels (what
## the shader actually renders), not ground heights — drop is the ground
## figure that qualified this as a steep span in the first place (the I1
## rule is a TERRAIN test, per steep_spans' own oracle).
## region absent (c.region == null, e.g. a ctx built without one) => no
## ground to scan => no spans, same graceful-fallback convention as
## level_at/_channel_membership_level elsewhere in this file.

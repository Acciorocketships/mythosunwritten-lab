# A boundary-conforming water sheet whose outer rim sits directly on
# WaterContour's smooth curves (Task 3), not on the old marching-squares
# mesher's own grid corners — this is the mesh that actually fixes the
# angular shoreline test_water_contour.gd's header documents. Two vertex
# families welded into one indexed surface:
#   - INTERIOR: a 2.0m world-aligned render lattice, kept only at points >= 2.0m
#     inside a curve. "Inside" = WaterField.level_at's OWN field-truth
#     wetness (the exact same wet/dry oracle WaterContour._is_wet uses to
#     place the curves in the first place — see _lattice_wet below), gated by
#     a presence-grid-accelerated distance-to-nearest-curve-point for the
#     INSET margin. A first implementation tried a pure geometric proxy
#     instead (nearest curve point + which side of ITS outward normal p sits
#     on, no field query at all) reasoning it was the direct generalization
#     of point-in-polygon to boundaries that may not close (a chunk's curves
#     are routinely OPEN here — verified empirically on SITE_CHUNK: 3/3
#     curves open, 0 closed, a river/lake network clipped by the chunk rect
#     never closes into a polygon on this terrain) — this task's OWN
#     test_no_free_edges_except_border caught it red-handed: a curve point's
#     normal is only a reliable inside/outside signal NEAR that point: at
#     world (45,-1149), 14.6m from the nearest curve point across a wide
#     open lake, the nearest point's LOCAL outward normal pointed the wrong
#     way for this far-away query, misclassifying real wet field territory
#     as dry and leaving a hole in the interior mesh with free edges nowhere
#     near any curve (see this task's report for the full transcript). The
#     field itself has no such blind spot — it is the ground truth the
#     curves are already contours OF, so lattice wetness and curve position
#     are consistent by construction, not by geometric coincidence. Height =
#     WaterField.level_at (the brief's own rule).
#   - BOUNDARY STRIP: one vertex per curve point, ON the curve, at the
#     curve's own baked level — zippered to the interior lattice's own
#     jagged edge ring via a greedy two-polyline triangle-strip walk (the
#     standard "bridge two open polylines" algorithm), so every triangle
#     touching the curve has exactly one edge shared with its strip neighbour
#     and one edge on each polyline — no T-junction is possible by
#     construction, because the interior grid's own quad triangulation never
#     touches a boundary vertex directly; only the strip does.
# MENISCUS RIM (Task 5, see _rim): five more rows per curve point, curling
# OUTWARD (dry side) and DOWN from the strip's own curve vertex (reused as
# row0) into either a buried bank seal or a compact rounded free/drop edge.
# This is what heals the strip's
# own former free edge (the curve itself, Task 4's documented "no rim yet"
# waterline) into interior geometry — the free-edge invariant TIGHTENS here:
# only true chunk borders or row5 (buried beneath a bank, or the bottom of a
# finite 65cm free-edge lobe) may be free edges from this task onward.
# FLOW FRAMES + REAL NORMALS (Task 6, see _flow_frame_at/_weld_vert): CUSTOM0
# is rebaked from Task 4's (flow.x, shore, flow.y, steep) to (s, d, slope,
# shore_dist) — continuous arc length/cross distance/profile slope along the
# nearest river trace (ponds: all zero), plus shore distance for every
# vertex regardless of mode. ARRAY_NORMAL stops being a blanket Vector3.UP:
# interior verts get a real heightfield normal (WaterField.level_at central
# differences); rim/strip rows get the meniscus curl's own local frame (UP
# rotated toward the curve's outward normal, more so per row, pinched back to
# UP at walls) — see _interior_normal/_curl_normal. _weld_vert now AVERAGES
# normals for verts that weld together (a parallel normal_accum array, summed
# on every weld hit, normalized once at the end by _bake_normals) instead of
# picking whichever call site happened to create the vertex first.
# ARRAY_COLOR.r carries a depth-limited displacement scale. The ambient
# spectrum plus packet-field clamp can trough by at most 1.0m, so shallow
# water retains 2cm of cover over the rendered bed. CUSTOM1 separately bakes
# the continuous current/vorticity/compression shared by GPU and CPU users.
# TRIGGERS + SAMPLER (Task 7, see _triggers/WaterSampler.gd): build() now
# returns a REAL `sampler` (a frozen WaterSampler snapshot of the water
# FIELD across this chunk: native 6m fill plus sparse 3m topology rescue,
# covering the FULL wet footprint including the INSET shoreline band — see
# WaterSampler.gd's own BACKING DATA note) instead of Task 4-6's `null`
# placeholder. `_triggers` gained the STEEP_UNSWIMMABLE gate the old
# marching-squares mesher's own volume builder used to enforce per 24m
# CELL: a tile whose max |grade_at| exceeds the gate gets no trigger box at
# all (steep water is not swimmable by design). This is the class's own
# terminal deliverable — WaterSurfaceBuilder.build_chunk now consumes
# `triggers`/`sampler` directly and the old mesher (and the per-cell sampled
# plane pair of metas it used to hang off each volume) is deleted outright;
# see r3 Task 7's report for the removal.
# SHORE CONTACT + FREE-EDGE BODY: ordinary rising banks use a compact
# overshoot; a contour wall flag earns the 1.5m KayKit recess reach only when
# that point's own outward column actually contacts high ground there. This
# prevents a flanking wall from stretching an unbounded edge into a skirt.
# A true drop instead keeps a compact 0.64m profile: 4cm crest, then rows at
# -6cm, -28cm, -55cm, and -65cm. It reads as finite rounded substance rather than a
# zero-thickness plane or a row teleported to the landing ground.

# Second trigger gate (Task 7 "Defect B", sub-tile-reconciled Task 9,
# RETIRED r3 Task 12b — see r3-task-12b-report.md for the full proof): a
# level-SPREAD heuristic (a whole-tile fast path, then a finer 6m sub-tile
# fallback) used to catch a cascade-step tile carrying fill water at an
# UPSTREAM reach's flat level over the face between it and a downstream
# reach — up to the full inter-reach step of phantom standing depth over
# what rendered as a thin film. That shape was a direct consequence of the
# OLD stepped profile model (pre r3 Task 12): one flat level per reach, a
# hard cut at each trace sample, so a whole shelf could stand unblended over
# a downstream face the fill could not otherwise reach.
#
# r3 Task 12/12a's smooth monotone descent (WaterField._dense_span_curve, a
# sill-riding Fritsch-Carlson-tangent envelope) removes the flat shelf this
# heuristic depended on: every point along a descent now gets its OWN
# locally-fit level instead of a shared plateau, so WaterField.level_at (and
# this class's own WaterSampler snapshot) already reads the honest LOCAL
# value everywhere a trigger might cover — proven at the site's own
# historical phantom points (the I1 chute film point, the 5.7 plunge-pool
# centre, and a third cascade cell this task's own audit found still gated)
# via level_at landing close to the local profile trend, never the old
# upstream shelf (~9.7). Deleting the whole mechanism outright — the
# whole-tile AND sub-tile constants, the _tile_level_spread/
# _level_spread_over dense scan, and _sub_tile_triggers' hot/one-hop-
# propagate logic — was the owner's own preference once the class it existed
# to catch was proven dead by construction, over carrying dead machinery
# "just in case". Triggers are simple wet-tile coverage now: STEEP_UNSWIMMABLE
# (above) is the ONLY remaining exclusion, because it is the one gate keyed
# on real TERRAIN steepness (a genuine unswimmable fall face), not on the
# fill's own internal level bookkeeping — which a smooth ramp can no longer
# use to distinguish "phantom shelf" from "ordinary legal slope" (a
# sustained-but-legal sloped reach can concentrate real, swimmable rise
# inside a small window exactly the same way a genuine cascade step does;
# smoothness and spread-based suppression turned out to be mutually
# exclusive by construction — see r3-task-12-report.md's own follow-up

## caught red on the pinned site and quantified by the reviewer as a third to
## half a wave cycle of Task 8 phase error; r3-task-6-report.md has the
## red->green transcripts). Nearest-point projection onto a polyline is
## genuinely FLAT across the outside wedge of any corner: for a corner C
## between segment directions w1/w2 (exterior angle theta), every query in
## the wedge {r.w1 >= 0, r.w2 <= 0} clamps BOTH candidate feet to C itself,
## so s reads exactly s(C) for the wedge's whole angular width — a shoreline
## walker at offset d crosses d*theta metres of walk (0.96m at the pinned
## site's own bend: d~8.8m, theta~6.2 deg) with ZERO s advance, which
## concentrated the polyline's intrinsic corner arc-length deficit into one
## 1.5m step (measured red: |Δs - step| = 1.008 against the test's 0.5
## bound). The first version hard-picked the strictly-nearest candidate,
## which cannot help — INSIDE the wedge both candidates' clamped s values
## are identical (s(C)), so no pick OR blend of clamped values ever advances.
## The fix blends the two candidates' UNCLAMPED (raw-t extrapolated) arc
## lengths whenever their clamped distances tie within SEG_TIE_BAND: the raw
## extrapolations straddle s(C) by ±d*sin(angle-into-wedge), so their blend
## advances at ~the walk rate through the wedge, spreading the deficit over
## the whole tie band (~2.5 steps either side at this site) instead of one
## step — measured post-fix worst |Δs - step| in the bend window: see the
## report (analytic prediction ~0.30). Blend weight mu = 0.5*(1 - tie/BAND),
## LINEAR in the distance DIFFERENCE, deliberately NOT the junction blend's
## literal 1/d^2: a same-trace tie's two distances are near-EQUAL by
## construction (both ~= the corner distance), so 1/d^2 degenerates to ~50/50
## across the entire band and then snaps to 0 at the band edge — a step of
## ~0.5*(s_far - s_near) ~= 0.46m, i.e. it would reintroduce the very
## discontinuity class being fixed. The difference-driven taper reaches 0
## continuously at the band edge (C0 with the pure-nearest region), and
## SEG_TIE_BAND's own derivation guarantees mu == 0 at every near-sample
## pair-flip locus (see the constant's comment), so the pair swap stays
## seamless. tangent and slope blend by the same mu (tangent renormalized;
## consecutive same-trace segment tangents never oppose, so no sign fix is
## needed, unlike the cross-trace junction blend); `dist`/`proj` stay the
## TRUE nearest's (the RIVER_MAX_DIST gate and the junction 1/d^2 weights
## must read real distances). The blended s clamps to [0, total] as a rail
## against raw-t extrapolation past the trace's global endpoints.

## trace" pattern mirrored here, per this task's own brief: reuse WaterField's

## Ponds/lakes: no candidate trace within RIVER_MAX_DIST=18m => s=d=slope=0
## (brief's own literal rule) — shore_dist is computed unconditionally, since
## it means "distance to shore" regardless of river/pond mode.
## Junction blending (brief: "two traces within 12m: weight by 1/d^2, blend s
## direction only"): with CUSTOM0 carrying no separate direction channel, "s
## direction" is read here as the LOCAL TANGENT the s axis is measured
## along — s and slope themselves still come entirely from the nearest trace
## alone (the plan doc's own words: "nearest-trace wins"; blending two
## different traces' raw arc-length numbers would be physically meaningless,
## e.g. averaging "1200m along the main stem" with "40m along a tributary").
## What DOES need blending is the axis d's sign is measured against: at a
## confluence, nearest-trace selection flips abruptly from one trace to the
## other as the query point crosses the zone's own midline, and each trace's
## raw tangent can point a different way — an unblended, hard-switched cross
## axis would show as a visible seam in the Task 8 wave direction right at
## that flip line. Blending the tangent (1/d^2-weighted, oriented onto the
## nearest trace's own tangent sense first so a tributary's "downstream"
## doesn't fight the main stem's) makes that axis rotate smoothly through the
## junction instead of snapping, while d's magnitude still reflects the true
## (nearest-trace) cross distance. Recorded here per the plan's own "Known
## judgment points delegated to implementers" note (junction blend falloff,

## point belonging to curve B legitimately also fell inside curve A's own
## capture radius, so curve A's OWN _order_ring_by_nn_chain call absorbed it

## add a stray point, it starved curve A's greedy nearest-neighbour chain at

## two ways — see _order_ring_by_nn_chain's own tie-break) ties two directions
## at equal distance: with contamination present, the tie's losing branch
## gets postponed past the ENTIRE rest of curve A's genuine ring and is
## finally forced to bridge to a contaminated point instead of doubling back
## to its own true neighbour (5 stranded free edges, all within 3m of the

## removes the contamination outright — the stranded corner point then
## legitimately becomes the chain's own LAST entry again, which the existing

## Rising banks extend rows2..5 to 0.40/0.60/0.70/0.78m. A contour wall flag is
## only allowed to extend them through the KayKit face when the point's own
## outward column finds sustained high ground within one 6m fill cell. The measured contact distance
## is added to the KayKit face's own 1.5m recess: the signed-depth waterline can
## sit between the terrain boundary and the contour, so a fixed 1.5m extrusion
## alone is not enough. At confirmed walls rows2..4 remain a water-level shelf
## through the visible face and another 0.30m behind it; the downward curl starts
## only between row4 and row5.  When adjacent wall normals turn, their outer
## tangent lines are intersected and the level shelf is mitred through that
## point instead of cutting the corner off with a diagonal chord. This keeps
## rounded cliff turns visibly full instead of meeting the wall with the bottom
## of a sloping meniscus. It also avoids letting an off-axis wall stretch a
## genuine free edge into a skirt. Smoothing the reach flags avoids sawteeth, but a
## local drop at 0.40m overrides that smoothing unless the direct wall-contact
## test succeeded. Free/drop edges consequently keep the compact four-step
## curl; bank edges disappear below terrain. Five quad bands connect adjacent
## columns, and open contours receive a four-triangle six-vertex end cap.

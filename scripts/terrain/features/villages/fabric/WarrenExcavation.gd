## The carved negative space: route walk cells, all removed cells, cover
## flags, transition specs, and portals. Pure data plus derived metrics.
##
## Cells are (x, band, z). A walk cell's y is the FLOOR band; the slot the
## carver removed above it spans HEADROOM_BANDS and lives in `carved`, so
## `carved` is the complete subtraction and `route` is only its floor.
##
## This object deliberately holds no reference to the massif it came out of.
## Every massif-relative invariant -- that the removed slot stayed inside the
## solid, that a cover flag is backed by mass actually left overhead, that a
## walk cell is flanked -- is therefore the carver's to enforce and the
## tests' to re-derive independently. Construction freezes the authored walk;
## validate_construction() inspects it without withdrawing or repairing it.

## Secondary lanes branching off the route, or off an earlier lane. Each entry
## is `{"anchor": Vector3i, "cells": Array[Vector3i],
## "transitions": Array[Dictionary]}` with exactly the route's own contract:
## `anchor` is a cell of the already-connected public realm, `cells` is the
## ordered walk leading away from it (stride intermediates included, as in
## `route`), and `transitions` tile `[anchor] + cells` under
## WarrenVolumeTransition's rise/run rules.
##
## Kept out of `route` rather than appended to it because `route` is one
## itinerary that seal() requires to be a single unbroken walk -- and because
## every gate the primary route answers to (span, cover, portals, wall ratio,
## grade phase) is a statement about that itinerary, not about the street
## network as a whole. A lane is public realm and a street wall for ownership
## and addressing; it is not part of the route those gates measure.
var lanes: Array[Dictionary] = []
## Explicit graph edges which close an already carved lane back onto an older
## public cell.  A loop edge owns no additional walk cell: its `from` and `to`
## endpoints are adjacent cells already present in `route`/`lanes`.  Keeping
## this separate from ordered lane walks lets the source remain a set of simple
## non-revisiting paths while still sealing a cyclic public graph.

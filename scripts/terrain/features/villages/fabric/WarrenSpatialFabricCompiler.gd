## TASK E4 ruling 1 -- the user's first binding direction measured on the
## RENDERED shell rather than on the source's own derivation of it.
##
## `WarrenMazeSourcePlan.exterior_stone_band_profile` measures the source's
## DERIVED rock: solid the plot layer gave to nobody. That is only half of
## what a viewer calls stone. `WarrenVolumetricSolver._retain_maze_rock`
## retains three more things as the same masonry -- a plot's roof band, the
## span of a released bridge, and above all UNROOMED PLOT MASS, the building
## the composition never managed to room (its own ceiling lives in the
## composition suite) -- and every one of those stands at PLOT heights, which
## is exactly where high stone would show. So the profile is measured a
## second time here, over `exposed_maze_stone_faces`, which is the shell the
## assembler really skins.
##
## Same datum rule, same threshold, same histogram shape as the source's, so
## the two numbers are directly comparable; a fine cell's band IS its macro
## band (`_fine_square` halves x and z only), and its column is that fine
## column floor-divided by two.
##
## `maze_stone_plot_mass_*` splits out the faces standing on mass some plot
## claims -- the difference between the two measurements, stated as a number
## instead of left to be inferred. FIX 1, IMPORTANT 1 SPLITS IT AGAIN, because
## "plot mass" is not a synonym for "a building the composition never roomed":
## a plot's `[floor, top)` also contains its ROOF BAND SPAN, which is roof by
## the height contract and where no room may ever stand
## (`WarrenMazeBlockPartitioner.plot_roof_band_span`). Stone there is the
## parapet course doing its job, not a shortfall, and calling it a quarry block
## was wrong. So `maze_stone_roof_band_high_face_count` and
## `maze_stone_unroomed_high_face_count` name the two halves and sum to
## `maze_stone_plot_mass_high_face_count`.
##
## `maze_stone_raised_shoulder_high_face_count` is task E4 ruling 2's
## measurement on this side: how much of the high stone stands on a no-plot
## column whose sealed shoulder grew above its own massif envelope. It is
## disjoint from both plot-mass halves by definition, since a raised-shoulder
## column carries no plot. `maze_stone_grounded_face_count` (fix 1, minor 4)
## is the source profile's own `grounded_faces` on this side: faces with no
## public floor inside the datum radius at all, read against bare terrain.
##
## Every key is zero on a legacy plan, which retains no maze stone and has no
## maze source to read a datum from.

			#
			# What stands on the cap is what tells the four apart, and only

			#
			# - PAVED: the public realm WALKS the cell above. Then the stone
			#   IS the street -- Task C5b measured that suppressing the cap
			#   under a terrain street or a stair left the mountain open to the
			#   sky, so the cap draws that walk surface, and "the street stands
			#   on stone" is this phase's own pinned design
			#   (`ROUTE_ON_STONE_FLOOR`).
			# - BORNE: a building's own `PRIVATE_VOLUME` stands there. The
			#   stone is that building's bearing. It shows only where the
			#   composition left the volume UNSTAMPED -- a room it reserved and
			#   never built -- which is a composition residue (the same one
			#   `maze_unroomed_plot_share` measures) and not a roof decision.
			# - BEARING: the cell is inside a flat-roofed STACK PARENT's own
			#   crown span, which `WarrenVolumetricSolver
			#   ._retain_maze_slab_courses` reserves as structure BEFORE the
			#   composition runs so a stacked child can prove its bearing
			#   against the grid. Task H2 tried twice to narrow that plate to
			#   the child's footprint and put it back both times: a child's
			#   COMPOSED room is not its plot, and either narrowing costs
			#   12/large its town. This is the one crown lid the phase did not
			#   retire, and it is counted rather than absorbed.
			# - RUBBLE: none of the above. Nothing stands on this crown,
			#   nothing walks it and nobody reserved it, so the masonry lid is
			#   exactly the fortress read the user rejected. Pinned at zero.

## TASK H1. THE WALL METRIC. `maze_stone_band_profile` above measures what the
## MASSIF is -- how much retained mountain shows and how high it stands. This
## measures what the TOWN WEARS: every exterior wall face of every room unit,
## sorted into the two material families a viewer can tell apart and bucketed by
## the same band-offset-over-local-street-datum the rock metric uses, through the
## same `WarrenMazeSourcePlan.nearest_datum_band` (reused, never re-derived, so
## "how much stone" and "how high the stone stands" cannot disagree about where
## the ground is).
##
## A wall FACE, not a wall MODULE: one lateral face of one room cell whose
## neighbour is exterior air (`EXTERIOR_WALL_NEIGHBOUR_USES`). Party walls and
## rock-buried faces are excluded because nobody sees them, which is the whole
## point of a metric named after the eye. The count is therefore directly
## comparable with the rock metric's face count rather than with a module tally
## whose denominator depends on how a recipe happens to be cut up.
##
## SCOPE, stated so nothing hides. ROOM units only, because rooms are the mass a
## viewer reads as the town. Two things are deliberately outside it and neither
## is silently absorbed: the retained massif skin, which is not a wall anybody
## chose and is measured by the `maze_stone_*` keys merged beside these ones and
## printed on the same sweep row; and FEATURE units -- arcade overhang
## foundations, the rising ring's `room.pier.base.rock` -- which are structural
## supports, read as masonry legitimately, and are named here rather than
## counted. `exterior_wall_unprofiled_unit_count` is the guard on the scope
## itself: a room unit whose stamp this walk never reached. It is 0 by
## construction and a non-zero is a defect, not a category.
##
## Also the base-coherence audit, because it needs the same enumeration.
## `fragmented_base_run_count` is the user's named defect: along ONE building's
## exterior face at one band, a stone run interrupted by a non-stone segment and
## resumed. A neighbouring building in a different material is a SEAM, not a
## fragment, so runs are cut at the lineage boundary. Openings cannot break a run
## by construction -- a doorway cell wears its own family's authored door leaf --
## so no opening exemption is needed and none is granted.

				# roof surface is already a horizontal plank lid (C5e ruling
				# 1), so a plank strip carrying it on is that crown's
				# vernacular rather than a modular lid pasted on a shoulder.
				# `_maze_lid_repair_neighbors` is the proof, and it is the
				# LINEAGE-AGNOSTIC half of this task: the continuing crown may
				# belong to another lineage, provided every room involved --
				# this one and each continuing neighbour -- is a maze flat
				# stamp that is not merely PREFERRING pitched (fix round 1,
				# IMPORTANT 1). The repaired cap is deliberately NOT counted in
				# `plain_cap_count`, for the same reason the tiling branch is
				# not: the forbidden-plain-cap gate is about exposed shoulders,
				# and this strip is proved not to be one.
				#
				# COVERAGE GAP, STATED (fix round 1, IMPORTANT 3). No corpus
				# town reaches this branch: a plot-flat crown only arrives at
				# the setback vocabulary when its tiling was refused by the
				# whole-set probe, and `maze_partial_plate_refused_count` is 0

	## The unit of the complaint is a BUILDING, not a room, so this works in
	## source lineages (`WarrenRoomStamp.source_parcel_id`, the same key
	## `_building_style_index` and H1's stone base use). A lineage is FLAT when
	## every crown it got is flat and PITCHED when every one is pitched; a
	## lineage carrying both is neither, and is counted in neither total --
	## a tall house with a pitched top and a flat shoulder is not a box.
	##
	## A lineage is ISOLATED when it is flat, it has at least one crown
	## neighbour, and every neighbouring lineage that carries a crown is
	## pitched. Neighbour means 4-adjacent CROWN COLUMNS: the columns of one
	## lineage's crown rooms, touching the columns of another's, which is what
	## the eye reads across a roofscape. A flat lineage with no crown neighbour
	## at all is a house standing on its own and is not the sprinkle defect, so
	## it does not count.
	##
	## FIX ROUND 1, MINOR 7 -- THE NEIGHBOUR READING IS APPROXIMATE WHERE
	## CROWNS STACK, and saying so is cheaper than a caveat nobody can find
	## later. `lineage_by_column` holds ONE lineage per column, so where two
	## lineages crown the same column -- a house stacked on another house's
	## shoulder, which this town does build -- the last one written wins and
	## the other is invisible to its neighbours' lookups. The count is
	## therefore a lower-ish estimate on stacked columns rather than an
	## identity, which is why it is published as a watched CEILING
	## (`ISOLATED_FLAT_CROWN_CEILING`) and not asserted against a
	## re-derivation. `columns_by_lineage` is exact -- every lineage keeps all

	##    not a look at all -- `sfbp.wwall.support.s.002` twice (a 0.316 m slab
	##    from 0.894 m to 4.500 m) and `sfv.fabric.brace.wood.002` once (from
	##    1.600 m) -- standing in streets a body cannot walk down. The clearance
	##    row could not see them: it commits the fabric dressing and no buildings
	##    (`warren_maze_mode_sweep.gd`'s own scope note), so the two censuses cover
	##    disjoint collision sets and both were honestly green.
	##
	##    WHAT `placement_collision_pieces` REALLY SAYS, because the sentence
	##    above is stronger than the test (r7+r8 review minor 3): it is
	##    `EnvironmentAssetDescriptor.collision_piece_count`, a PER-ASSET count,
	##    and the geometry this rule then measures is the placement's VISUAL box.
	##    No individual collider hull is ever consulted. So the gate reads "this
	##    asset bakes collision AND its drawn geometry is in the body column",
	##    which is one-sided in the safe direction for a census and NOT the same
	##    statement as "a body walks into this hull": a brace whose baked shape
	##    hugs the wall can be withdrawn on the strength of a box that reaches
	##    into the street. Three withdrawals ride on it, each one measured in the
	##    r6 review by loading the shapes.
	##
	## THE RULE IS DECOR-ONLY FOR BURIAL AND THAT IS A DECISION (review minor 8).
	## Only branch 1 is gated on `is_decor`; an OUTRIGGER module buried in the
	## cladding is never withdrawn, and 93 brace and support placements across
	## seven towns do share volume with the exact skin. They are not defects: a
	## diagonal brace is AUTHORED to meet a wall, and its world AABB is a rotated
	## box that hugely overstates the hull it draws -- the same argument this
	## round makes for the plaza tree's crown, and the reason the collider branch
	## above rules the braces instead. Withdrawing a brace because its bounding
	## box meets the masonry it leans on would take out the timber that reads as
	## holding the storey up, to fix nothing anybody can see.
	##
	## OPTIONAL DRESSING NEVER OCCUPIES THE PLAYER'S EXTERIOR SWEPT PRISM. This
	## includes collider-free ivy, flowers, and planters: walking through a white
	## leaf shard is still a visible defect even when physics permits it. The
	## canonical exterior network (sealed public floors plus reachable roof
	## terraces) is computed before suppression, so this is one geometric
	## contract rather than asset-name exceptions.
	##
	## WHY THIS IS NOT A SECOND COMPILE. Both inputs are already here and neither
	## depends on the outcome: `maze_skin_panel_boxes` is a pure function of the
	## retained, solid, paved and plinth cell sets, and `walked_floor_cells` is
	## the surface plan's. A suppression removes a VISUAL placement and nothing
	## else -- no semantic cell, no envelope, no bound -- so nothing upstream of
	## this point can change under it and nothing downstream sees a town it was
	## not built from.

	# a coursed masonry face 0.221 m of depth it does not occupy -- and the review
	# measured the cost: THREE of this pass's 66 withdrawals shared no volume at
	# all with the cladding their towns really build (12/compact's
	# `garden.flower` at -0.189 m, 1/grand's `facade.sign` at -0.104 m,
	# 9/standard's `garden.flower` at -0.051 m). Three modules were deleted from
	# finished towns for a wall that is not there.
	#
	# WHY THE TREATMENTS CAN BE READ HERE WITHOUT A FEEDBACK LOOP, which is the
	# objection `MAZE_SKIN_PANEL_HALF_DEPTH` was written against. Only the SIDE
	# faces carry a depth into `maze_skin_panel_boxes`, and a side face's
	# treatment is decided by its BANK HEIGHT alone -- `maze_bank_height` over
	# `exposed`, plus the natural-cut fallback, none of which reads the footprint
	# index. The footprints steer cap faces only (`_maze_cap_is_free` and the
	# small-garden demotion), and a cap contributes either a soffit box, whose
	# depth is fixed, or -- for a sky-facing cap -- no box at all. So the panel
	# boxes are the same array with the index and without it, and this pass
	# passes NO footprints on purpose: the one input that could move under its own
	# outcome is the one input it does not take.
	#
	# The stand-off in `_frontage_window_offsets` keeps the union, and keeps it
	# for its own reason: standing a barrel 0.221 m further off a wall than it
	# strictly must is free, while withdrawing a flower from a wall that is not

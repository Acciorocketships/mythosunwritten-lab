## risers between houses, and the mass beside and above a street the excavation
## cut through the hill, which is what makes a covered route read as a passage
## instead of a trench. SettlementFabricAssembler draws only the part of it a
## building stands over -- a foundation plinth and the mountain substrate under
## it; a column nothing is built on is not drawn at all. Deliberately excluded
## from occupancy either way, so it claims no socket and enters no
## visual-envelope or solid/void test.

## FAMILY a clad mass face belongs to. A fake storey and the real house beside
## it must share a palette, and the palette is
## `WarrenSpatialFabricCompiler.architectural_district_theme(origin, seed)` --
## the same district field every real room's recipe is chosen through. Deriving
## a second field off the plan's own id would give the mass its own colouring
## and put a blue wall against an orange neighbour on the same block.
##
## A PLAIN FIELD, not an audit key, because the skin is derived TWICE: once for
## the payload (on a sealed plan) and once for `_maze_stone_skin_audit` (on a
## plan the compiler has not sealed yet, whose `audit` is still empty). One
## field answers both. It rides outside `construction_signature()` on purpose --
## that signature is seed-independent by contract -- and a legacy plan leaves it
## 0, which is inert because a legacy plan tags no maze stone at all.

## The second cannot be asserted cheaply and is stated instead: a unit's
## `recipe_id`, `lattice_origin` and `yaw_quarters` are FIXED once it has been
## accepted, so the box stays the one its transform implies. Nothing in this
## repository writes those three fields after construction (one test sets
## `lattice_origin` on a unit it never adds to a plan), and `validate()` is the
## backstop: it re-derives every unit's bounds from scratch at seal time and
## refuses a plan whose stored `bounds` no longer match, which is exactly the

##
## Round 6 shipped it as a free function over `expanded_placements()`, and five
## production call sites plus one per pin per town in the tests each built their
## own copy of the same answer. It is a pure function of the units, their
## recipes, and their suppressions, so ONE copy per plan is the same dictionary
## every caller built for itself; the two writers that can move it -- `add_unit`
## and `suppress_placement` -- clear it, so a mid-compile reader can never be
## handed a town that no longer exists.

## TASK I4, ANNOTATION 4. How far into a connected neighbour a ROOF shell has to
## reach before the pair stops being a seam of any kind and becomes the
## "disappearing into the wall" the annotation circled. BOTH bounds have to be
## exceeded together, and both are read off the vocabulary rather than chosen:
##
## * IN PLAN, HALF A CELL. A roof that laps less than half a cell into the thing
##   beside it still has its body on its OWN side of the shared boundary, which
##   is a junction meeting a neighbour; past half a cell its body is centred
##   inside the neighbour's cell, which is a shell standing in it. The bound is
##   the lattice's own, not a taste: `FabricRecipe.CELL_SIZE * 0.5`.
## * IN HEIGHT, more than 1.00 m. The one-band contact a roof makes with the
##   wall head it lands on is exactly 1.5 m, so a bound at 1.5 admits every
##   embed the corpus actually has; but that contact is a DIRECT BEARING pair
##   and is exempted above by name. What is left at 1.5 m is a roof inside an
##   unrelated neighbour, and 1.00 m is comfortably under it while staying well
##   over the 0.25 m a typed flashing may overlap.
##
## THE PLAN BOUND WAS 0.50 m FIRST -- the lateral seam allowance `lateral_seam_ok`
## already admits -- AND THAT WAS TOO TIGHT, measured rather than argued. At
## 0.50 m the gate refused `roof.tower.orange` AND `roof.tower.chimney.orange` on
## `parcel.maze.house.004.part01.room00` of 3/standard, both against the same
## unrelated upper room and both by 0.583 m in plan; the compiler's fallback
## chain ran out and the crown shipped with NO ROOF UNIT ON TWO OF ITS FACES
## (`test_partial_plates_are_tiled`, and the production-site test with it). A
## hole in a roof is a worse artefact than the seam the bound was removing, so
## the bound moved to the first defensible number above it.
##
## MEASURED on the four planner towns at 0.75 m: the pairs it refuses read
## 0.77-1.20 m in plan over 1.5-3.4 m of height, and the annotation's own worst
## pair -- a roof 1.198 m into an upper room over 3.0 m -- is still refused, which
## is the whole point. The typed seams the vocabulary relies on read 0.16-0.50 m
## in plan and are untouched. Every planner town still composes AND still closes

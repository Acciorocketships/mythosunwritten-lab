## One-pass entry point for the constructive maze-town pipeline: massif ->
## carve (unsealed) -> reserve (assets + decks) -> partition (houses, heights,
## bridges) -> seal. Every phase is pure and costs milliseconds, so
## `stop_after` simply re-runs the pipeline from scratch up to and including
## the named phase and hands back the still-unsealed plan; the debug view that
## wants a mid-pipeline snapshot calls plan() again with a different
## stop_after rather than this planner keeping any state of its own between
## calls.

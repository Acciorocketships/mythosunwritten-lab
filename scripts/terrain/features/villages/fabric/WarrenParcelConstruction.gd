	## HOW FAR A ROOM STACK DESCENDS BELOW ITS ADDRESSED LEVEL.
	##
	## READ THE MODE FIRST. Everything from here to "THE STOREY PARITY" is the
	## ROUTE-FIRST and MASS-FIRST contract, where the mass under a house is
	## unclaimed massif a stack may take. **A MAZE PARCEL NEVER DESCENDS AT
	## ALL** -- in the plot model that mass belongs to somebody, and the plot
	## says where the house starts -- so none of the reasoning below applies to
	## it. That branch, and the three tasks that measured and reverted it before
	## Task C6 shipped it, are at the foot of this doc block just above the
	## `maze_source` test.
	##
	## A uniform room stack may descend only when every footprint column owns a
	## continuous source-mass bearing path. Mixed-span parcels intentionally stay
	## at their addressed level; a later explicit overhang/support recipe must
	## carry them without filling a public passage below.
	##
	## It descends to the envelope's BEARING datum, which is natural ground
	## unless the envelope declares a terrace above it. That distinction is the
	## whole difference between a hill town and a tower: a street eight bands up
	## flanked by six of mass stands on fourteen bands of solid, and descending a
	## house through all fourteen is what a viewer counts as seven storeys. The
	## mass below the terrace is hill, not house.
	##
	## PER COLUMN AND HONEST since the terrain milestone's Wave 5. The datum is
	## the HIGHEST bearing band under the footprint -- each column's own stamped
	## ground, sampled rather than inferred -- so the stack rests on the real
	## surface of the highest ground it covers and never floats over it. Where a
	## footprint straddles a terrace step, the columns below that datum are the
	## gap `retained_terrace_cells` declares and the assembler fills with
	## sfv.foundation.rock plinth stone: the downhill side gets the course of
	## stone that makes the house one storey taller, which is what a plinth is
	## FOR.
	##
	## THE STOREY PARITY, which is the whole of the old defect. A stack meets its
	## address only on a whole STOREY_BANDS boundary, and a ground band of the
	## wrong parity has to be resolved one way or the other. Resolving it DOWN --
	## `result -= 1` -- buries the house one band under its own ground, and that
	## single line, not hill geometry, is what put 211 of 424 mass-first houses
	## into the earth against zero plinths (task-23-report §4). An envelope that
	## declares a `plinth_budget_bands` resolves it UP instead, onto one band of
	## stone, which is a thing a viewer can see and a mason would build. The
	## budget also bounds it: a straddle whose plinth would exceed the allowance
	## falls back to the cut rather than growing a masonry terrace.

	#
	# Descent is a route-first idea: there, a parcel addressed from an upper

	# at natural ground, and the mass it descends through is unclaimed massif.
	# In MAZE mode the mass under a plot is either derived rock -- which a
	# house may still take, and does, so a hill column becomes storeys rather
	# than a podium -- or ANOTHER PLOT, which is somebody else's building.
	#
	# Descending into that other plot made two parcels claim one cell in
	# `_partition_rooms`'s protected-owner map, and `_plate_fits` then refused
	# BOTH of them: measured as 9 of 29, 12 of 32 and 6 of 35 parcels composing
	# no lineage on the three sealing seeds, in mutually-blocking pairs, which
	# was the single largest source of unroomed plot mass.
	#
	# `rock_shoulder` is the source's own answer for the top of derived rock on
	# a column, and on a column carrying plots it IS that column's lowest plot
	# floor. So a parcel whose floor stands above it on any column has a plot
	# underneath and stays where the plot planner put it; a parcel sitting
	# directly on the rock descends exactly as it did before, which is what
	# keeps every rock-borne house in this corpus byte-identical.
	#
	# MEASURED AND REVERTED THREE TIMES: NO DESCENT AT ALL. Returning
	# `base_band` for every maze parcel -- the plot model taken literally, so a
	# house on a hill column becomes a short house on a tall stone base rather
	# than storeys -- was better on C5c's number (12/compact 0.200 unroomed
	# with 1 uncomposed parcel of 29, against 0.267 and 6) and cost 4/compact
	# and 3/standard their towns at PITCHED roof gates. Task C5d made maze
	# houses flat-roofed by default, removed those crowns, and re-applied it:
	# the 24-seed maze sweep went 10/24 sealed DOWN to 9/24 and 3/standard lost
	# its town again, at a PARTIAL PLATE -- `roof remainder for
	# spatial.parcel.maze.house.033 ... 1-cell exposed sliver` -- which is the
	# one roof family flat-first could not remove.
	#
	# TASK C5e re-applied it a THIRD time, with the partial-plate vocabulary
	# finally in place (`WarrenSpatialFabricCompiler._tile_flat_plate`), and it
	# is no longer a strict loss -- it is a TRADE, which is why the numbers are
	# here in full rather than summarised:
	#
	# * every planner seed still seals (12/compact, 4/compact, 3/standard AND
	#   9/standard), which is ruling 4's own gate, and the composition is far
	#   better -- unroomed plot mass 0.226/0.211/0.281/0.260 -> 0.156/0.142/
	#   0.224/0.176, uncomposed parcels 6/3/4/6 -> 1/1/2/1, back-room stamped
	#   share 0.806/0.692/0.587/0.558 -> 0.838/0.700/0.739/0.585;
	# * its ONLY cost is the CORPUS: 18/24 sealed DOWN to 16/24. It gains
	#   6/compact and loses 1/standard, 10/standard and 11/compact, all three
	#   at `authored room envelope gate failed: room ... failed measured phase
	#   selection` -- the family 12/standard already dies at, not a roof gate.
	#
	# REVIEW FIX 1 CORRECTS THIS ENTRY. The first pass also charged relaxation
	# 1 with dropping route-floor-on-stone to 0.968/0.950/0.979, which was
	# wrong: that was a defect in the parapet release measured in the same run
	# (`WarrenVolumetricSolver._maze_released_parapet_cells` was taking away
	# the band a tiered house's own street floor stands on). With the release
	# fixed, relaxation 1 re-measured at **1.000 on all four towns** -- it
	# costs nothing there.
	#
	# TASK C6 SHIPS IT, and the condition C5e attached to it was met first.
	# The three towns relaxation 1 used to cost -- 1/standard, 10/standard and
	# 11/compact -- all died in the `failed measured phase selection` family,
	# and that family was an ORDERING defect rather than a vocabulary limit:
	# an optional phase-B facade projection hung off a house at a low band
	# reached into the mandatory shell of a house at a higher band that had not
	# been compiled yet (`WarrenSpatialFabricCompiler._required_room_clearance`
	# is the fix, C6 ruling 1).
	#
	# MEASURED WITH THAT FIX IN PLACE, which is the only comparison that means
	# anything now: the 24-seed corpus is 19/24 WITHOUT no-descent and 20/24
	# WITH it. No seed is lost -- the three it used to cost all keep their
	# towns -- and it gains 6/compact, whose diagonal-outcropping refusal goes
	# away when its parcels stop reaching down through each other. Per planner
	# seed (12/compact, 4/compact, 3/standard, 9/standard) it takes unroomed
	# plot mass 0.226/0.211/0.281/0.260 -> 0.156/0.142/0.224/0.176 and
	# uncomposed parcels 6/3/4/6 -> 1/1/2/1, with route floor on stone still
	# 1.000 on all four.
	#
	# So a maze parcel now takes the plot model literally: it never descends,
	# and a house on a hill column is a short house on a tall stone base rather
	# than storeys of house buried in the mountain. `rock_shoulder` no longer

## Additive (2026-08-22, controller ruling on the plot model): this parcel's
## roof is a SLAB rather than the authored pitched reservation, so its height
## owes the storey grid nothing beyond one storey and that slab (see
## `_height_is_legal`). It was originally set only where something stood ON
## the top band -- an upper street, a terrace, or another building -- and Task
## C5d made it the plot model's DEFAULT: every maze house is flat-roofed,
## because the tiered hill town's vernacular is the flat roof.
## `WarrenMazeBlockPartitioner.plot_is_flat_roofed` owns that rule and
## `plot_crown_carries_public_realm` keeps the older, narrower reading for the
## one consumer that still needs it. Defaulted false and never set by a legacy
## caller, so every parcel the route-first pipeline builds keeps the exact
## contract it always had.
##
## READ BY THE PLAN'S SUPPORT RULE since Task C3: a flat roof is one band of
## SLAB, so a building stacked on this parcel stands on `top_band` rather than
## on `roof_base_band()`, and `WarrenParcelPlan._building_support_is_valid`
## admits exactly that seam for a flat-roofed parent.
##
## READ BY THE ROOF COMPILER since Task C5, which is what closed the older
## split: `WarrenParcelConstruction.proposal()` seeds `proposal["flat_roof"]`
## from this field, `WarrenRoomStamp` carries it, and
## `WarrenSpatialFabricCompiler.compile_roof_units` gives such a crown the
## authored `roof.flat.*` slab. It shares its name with the staggered roof
## flag `WarrenAssetCompiler` sets at :951/:952 and :987/:988 and
## `StaggeredFabricCompiler` consumes at :458, which still OVERWRITES the
## proposal key on the legacy path; the name is deliberate and stays, because
## they mean the same thing about a building.

## Additive (Task C5d, controller ruling 2; WIDENED BY TASK H2): what the plot

## `&"pitched"` whenever the crown is FREE -- no stacked child, no upper street
## and no other plot in its own columns at its top band -- which since H2 is
## the ORDINARY house rather than the exception (`WarrenMazeBlockPartitioner
## .plot_prefers_pitched_roof`, which supersedes C5d's "strictly above every
## neighbour, then a coin" and says why).
##
## A PREFERENCE, never a contract. `flat_roof` still decides the height rule,
## the storey count and the roof base band; this only asks
## `WarrenSpatialFabricCompiler.compile_roof_units` to try the authored
## pitched shell on that crown first, and a shell that would displace or
## halo-conflict is refused back to the slab and counted.

## WarrenExcavationVolumeAdapter._add_transitions populates via
## `add_public_air` for exactly the cells `WarrenExcavation.carved` removed;

## Adapts a Task 2 WarrenExcavation (negative space carved from a Task 1
## WarrenMassif) into the sealed WarrenVolumePlan the downstream parcel/
## asset/construction pipeline already consumes. Nothing about the walk,

## copied straight from the massif and the excavation, so a sealed plan can
## only describe the geometry those two objects already agreed on.

	## An earlier revision instead made every carved cell (including a
	## STAIR/RAMP's intermediate stride cell) a walk cell, and wired the
	## orphaned intermediate into the graph with a LEVEL "spur" transition so
	## WarrenVolumePlan._all_walk_connected() would not strand it. That solved

	## for a vertical transition always claims the intermediate macro column's
	## complete two-lane surface (its stair/ramp tread), and

	## 2x2 surface square of its own -- so a walk node at that exact column
	## collided with the transition node claiming the same ground. That
	## surface_cells() geometry is shared, protected code (pinned by
	## tests/test_warren_excavation.gd, which requires every cell it claims to
	## already be carved); it cannot change to make room for a second owner.
	## The only cell-for-cell-legitimate fix is therefore the one below: the
	## intermediate never becomes a walk cell in the first place, so there is
	## no orphan to strand and no second claimant to collide -- exactly

## TASK F3 MEMBER 3 -- MEASURED, AND DELIBERATELY NOT RETUNED. The brief asked
## whether 4 is a searched-town number that misjudges every maze plaza now that
## E2's momentum work made streets longer and straighter. Measured over the
## 24-town corpus plus the production settlement, it is not.
##
## Those 25 towns form ELEVEN complete canopy candidates between them, and
## their open horizons are 2 (once), 4 (four times), 8 (once) and 10 (five
## times). Ten IS `MARKET_SHELTER_HORIZON_LIMIT_CELLS`, the sight ray's own
## bound: those five are not near misses at the cap, they are mouths with no
## termination anywhere in the ray's reach, which is the single failure mode
## `_market_shelter_audit` exists to catch. The one candidate at 8 belongs to
## 2/standard, which already builds its bazaar from a 4-cell candidate that
## outranks it. So raising this constant anywhere from 5 to 9 gives NO town a
## market it does not already have, and raising it to 10 buys four marketless
## towns a bazaar looking straight out of the hill.
##
## The cap is also not what makes 19 of the 24 corpus towns marketless.
## `_market_public_aisle` is: the funnel runs 84-200 sockets to 16-56 ground
## fits to 1-22 body fits and then to 0-2 aisle fits, and SIXTEEN of the 24
## corpus towns arrive at the aisle test with bodies that fit and leave it with
## nothing (3/standard loses 22 of them there). Widening the aisle rule is a

	## `floor - 1` -- rock, or a house roof -- so paving it is exactly what
	## `_carve_public_volume` does for a bored street: the band itself and the
	## headroom above it become PUBLIC_AIR, and the floor band claims a
	## PUBLIC_FLOOR face. Folding the result into `route_floors` is what
	## carries it to `WarrenSpatialPlan`, and from there to the public-realm
	## adapter and the surface solver that actually lay the paving.
	##
	## The carve is deliberately STRICT about what it may take: a deck column
	## is refused upstream unless `plot_support_ok` finds solid at `floor - 1`
	## and no carved band in the MIN_HOUSE_BANDS above it, so a deck can never
	## overlap a street's own air, and a collision here is a generator defect
	## that must be loud rather than silently absorbed.
	##
	## DECK COUPLINGS. A deck cell is indistinguishable from a bored street
	## cell to everything that reads the grid, which is the point -- it is a
	## public floor -- but three later stages change their answer because of
	## it, and each is a real behaviour change rather than a formality:
	##
	## (a) `_parcel_address_has_public_floor` accepts a parcel whose door
	##     landing is a deck cell, so a parcel that used to be counted in
	##     `rejected_unfloored_address_count` can now enter composition. Decks
	##     ADD parcels, and an empty proposal list is a hard rejection, so this
	##     coupling can only help a town -- but it does move the room set.
	##     Counted as `maze_deck_addressed_parcel_count`.
	## (b) `_carve_route_connected_rooftop_court` skips any crown that already
	##     carries a face claim or a reservation, so a deck lying on a house
	##     roof removes that crown from the roof-court candidates. (Its seam
	##     set is separately restricted to cells owned by `public.route`, so a
	##     deck can never SUPPLY the seam either.)
	## (c) `_backfill_residual_rooms` builds its route set from every
	##     PUBLIC_AIR cell carrying a PUBLIC_FLOOR face, ignoring owner, so
	##     deck cells count as uncovered route floors and as frontage sides.
	##     The greedy scan is therefore biased toward roofing and fronting the
	##     plazas, exactly as it is toward streets.

## TASK E4 FIX 2 -- THE TRIM'S "NO FOOTPRINT COLUMN ANSWERED" SENTINEL, and it
## is INT_MIN rather than -1 because a datum is legally NEGATIVE.
##
## Round 1 started `_maze_trimmed_plot_stone`'s per-plot datum at -1, took the
## highest with `maxi`, and skipped the plot while the answer was still below
## zero. Both halves were wrong on real ground, and wrong in the same place:
## `VillageWarrenFabricSolver._sample_ground_bands` writes each column's band as
## `ceili((surface_y - world_frame.origin.y) / VERTICAL_BAND_SIZE_M)`, so every
## column whose terrain falls below the placement's own origin hands
## `WarrenMassifBuilder` a negative base -- and `local_public_datum`'s terrain
## fallback, plus any street standing on that terrain, is negative with it.
## `maxi(-1, d)` clamped the real ground away and the `datum < 0` guard then
## disabled the trim on the whole town, exactly where the terrain is real.
##
## Nothing in the flat corpus or the sloped fixtures can reach that town (every
## `StampedGround` frame is non-negative by construction), which is why 24 towns
## and four sloped rows never saw it; `test_the_stone_trim_reads_a_datum_below
## _the_frame_origin` builds it directly.

## TASK E4 FIX 1 -- THE TRIM. The user's first binding direction, applied

## above the public floor the plot itself stands on, so the quarry block a
## composition failure leaves behind stops being a masonry cliff and becomes a
## low stump. Maze-only: every reader below is empty for a searched volume.
##
## ONE HEIGHT PER PLOT, never per cell. `trim_top = datum +
## LOW_STONE_BANDS + 1`, where `datum` is the HIGHEST
## `WarrenMazeSourcePlan.local_public_datum` any of the plot's own footprint
## columns answers at that column's `lowest_plot_floor` -- the ground the town
## really starts from there, and the street it belongs to. Highest rather than
## lowest, deliberately: a plot fronting an upper terrace may not be trimmed
## down to the street at the bottom of the hill, and the conservative reduction
## is the one that trims LESS. The `+ 1` is the ruling's own: two storeys of
## stone plus the band that caps them.
##
## TWO REFUSALS, one principle -- NOTHING MAY BE LEFT STANDING OVER RELEASED
## AIR. A plot refuses to trim, and is counted in `refused`, when either:
##
##   1. another plot stands at or above its own `top` on any footprint column
##      (releasing its head would strand that plot's mass, whether the
##      composition roomed it or retained it), or
##   2. a route floor walks on a band the release would take -- inside the
##      released span, or directly on top of it. The ruling asks for
##      `route_on_stone` and `holes[OUTSIDE]` to be RE-MEASURED, and the C5e
##      precedent is exactly this failure: releasing a flat crown's parapet
##      took away the band a tiered house's street floor stood on and left
##      walk cells over `Use.OUTSIDE`. Refusing by construction is cheaper
##      than measuring the same defect a second time, and it is the same
##      sentence as refusal 1 with "a street" in place of "a plot".
##
## `{cells: {fine cell: true}, refused: int, trimmed_plots: int}`.

	## TASK C5e RULING 2, WIDENED BY TASK H2 -- THE WHOLE CROWN IS RELEASED TO
	## AIR WHEREVER NOTHING STANDS ON IT.
	##
	## A flat-roofed plot's crown is `[flat_roof_base_band, top)`: the first
	## band carries the authored one-band `roof.flat.*` slab the roof compiler
	## builds, and on the EVEN heights the planner produces one more band is
	## left over. Both used to end up retained STONE, and that is why every
	## crown in the C5d captures reads from above as a stone block with a
	## timber sill: the slab is INSIDE a solid course of masonry, and
	## `SettlementFabricAssembler.maze_stone_walls` caps its sky-facing
	## boundary with a rock panel laid flat.
	##
	## C5e released `[roof_base + 1, top)` on non-parents only, which left two
	## rubble populations the H2 renders are about: the slab band itself
	## (retained on every column the composition did not put a room under, and
	## even under the plank slab, because `_retain_maze_rock` claims any solid
	## `OUTSIDE` cell), and the WHOLE plate of every stack parent
	## (`_maze_flat_slab_cells` claimed it before composition, so this function
	## could not reach it at all). Measured on the six-town identity corpus,
	## 9 to 58 stone caps per town stood inside a plot's own roof band span.
	##
	## THE RULE IS NOW ONE SENTENCE, AND THE GRID ANSWERS IT. Walking each fine
	## column of the span from the top down, a band is KEPT as soon as
	## something the town built stands on it -- a room (`PRIVATE_VOLUME`, which
	## is how a stacked child announces itself), structure another pass already
	## claimed (`STRUCTURAL_VOLUME`: the child's own bearing course, a feature's
	## reservation), or a public floor that walks there (`route_floors`, the
	## same set the composition test measures `ROUTE_ON_STONE_FLOOR` against).
	## Everything ABOVE the highest kept band is released; everything at or
	## below it stays, so no retained cell of a crown is ever left standing
	## over released air, and the C5e CRITICAL -- a tiered house's street floor
	## losing the band it stands on -- cannot come back through the wider rule.
	##
	## Asking the GRID rather than the plot model is what makes the widening
	## safe. The plot layer knows a stack parent by name but not which of its
	## columns the child's composed rooms really occupy, nor which crowns a
	## rooftop court, a bridge deck or a market floor ended up walking; every
	## one of those is a `PRIVATE_VOLUME`, `STRUCTURAL_VOLUME` or route-floor
	## fact by the time this runs, which is after `_discard_unassigned_mass`
	## and `_derive_shell`. The plot model still owns the one question the grid
	## cannot answer yet -- see `_maze_flat_slab_cells`, which reserves the
	## child's bearing BEFORE composition so the composition can prove it.
	##
	## A STACK PARENT'S CROWN APPEARS IN THIS SET AND IS NEVER ACTUALLY
	## RELEASED, and that is worth saying rather than filtering. Its whole
	## plate is already `STRUCTURAL_VOLUME` by the time this runs
	## (`_retain_maze_slab_courses` claims it before composition), and
	## `_retain_maze_rock` only ever claims or releases cells that are still
	## `OUTSIDE` -- so a parent crown listed here is inert. Filtering it out
	## would not be free: `_repair_stranded_release` reads membership of this
	## set as "will not be stone", so removing those entries would make the
	## repair take MORE cells back. The set is left as the plain statement of
	## which crowns are free, and the grid decides what that costs.
	##
	## Nothing about the massing moves: `WarrenParcelPlan
	## .building_support_is_valid`, `WarrenBuildingParcel.top_band` and every
	## deterministic signature are untouched, so a plot's `top` remains the
	## envelope it always was while the BUILT crown stops at its plank plate.

	##

	##
	## The predicate is `_retain_maze_rock`'s own retention test, restated in

	## ASKS OF THE CELL ABOVE. Round 1 tested only the cell ABOVE and then
	## erased this one, which quietly assumed that un-releasing a cell makes it
	## stone. It does not: `_retain_maze_rock` claims a cell only when the SAME
	## predicate holds of the cell itself, so a take-back on a cell the trim
	## already took, on one another feature reserved, on a carved street or on

	## count with a repair that never happened. So the cell is taken back, the
	## predicate is asked of it, and it is PUT BACK when the answer is no.
	##
	## The take-back is geometry-neutral by construction either way -- a cell
	## that fails the predicate is one `_retain_maze_rock` would skip whether
	## or not it sits in `released` -- so what this fix corrects is the
	## HONESTY of the count and of the release total, and the descent below
	## still stops for the right reason: the cell stays released, the cell

	# MEASURED on the production seed (166029932451774690, compact,
	# 2026-08-25): `_preplan_spatial_market` finds 132 sockets, 40 ground
	# fits, 2 body fits, 1 aisle fit, 1 clearance fit and forms exactly ONE
	# complete canopy candidate -- which its own viability filter then drops
	# because the candidate's open horizon is 10 cells against a compact limit
	# of MAX_MARKET_OPEN_HORIZON_CELLS = 4. So no reservation is ever made:
	# market-ness stops at preplan, not at construction, and the town's
	# `advisory_shortfalls.covered_market = 0` is an honest record of that.
	# The gate is kept as a cheap invariant guard on a state nothing produces
	# today.
	#
	# TASK F3 MEMBER 3 -- CLASSIFIED HONEST, no repair made, and here is why
	# the three candidate repairs were each declined on a measurement.
	#
	# (a) The horizon cap is not miscalibrated. That 10 is exactly
	# `MARKET_SHELTER_HORIZON_LIMIT_CELLS`: the sight ray walked its whole
	# reach without meeting mass, so this candidate's aisle mouth looks
	# straight out of the hill. Over the 24-town corpus plus this settlement
	# only eleven candidates exist at all, at horizons 2, 4 (x4), 8 and 10
	# (x5); every cap from 5 to 9 leaves every town exactly as it is. The
	# constant carries the numbers.
	#
	# (b) Candidate generation is narrow, but not at the market's own filter.
	# The funnel loses towns at `_market_public_aisle`: sixteen of the 24
	# corpus towns arrive there with bodies that fit and leave with nothing,
	# and every candidate that survives it also survives
	# `_market_backing_composition_survives` -- the backing check has never
	# rejected one. Widening the aisle rule would change towns and is a design
	# question, not a defect: Phase G.
	#
	# (c) A marketless compact town is honest. `WarrenVillageScaleProfile`
	# gives compact and standard `requires_covered_market = false`; only large
	# and grand require a bazaar. Five of the 24 corpus towns do build one
	# (2/standard, 6/compact, 6/standard, 7/standard, 8/compact), so
	# market-ness is reachable rather than dead -- this settlement is one of the
	# nineteen that ship without, and it says so.
	#
	# TASK F4 corrected "and neither scale seals a single town of the 12-seed
	# corpus", which was true when it was written and is not now: large seals 3
	# of 12 and grand 1 of 12, and ALL FOUR build the bazaar their profile
	# requires. The `covered_market = 0` shortfall published at :1863 is
	# consequently still unreachable in practice at those scales -- not because
	# the market always fits, but because a large or grand town whose market
	# never preplans is rejected by `WarrenSpatialFeatureSolver.solve`'s
	# `requires_covered_market` arm before it can ship the shortfall. That
	# contradiction costs 7 of the 12 large seeds and is task F4's handoff.
	#
	# Court/landmark/skywalk counts are richness — a shortfall is recorded and
	# the town ships plainer rather than not at all.
	#
	# TASK F4 FIX 1. `courtyard_bridge_reservation.is_empty()` was the wrong test
	# and always had been. `_maze_dressed_court_candidate` stamps the courtyard
	# feature id onto EVERY court reservation, the absent sentinel included, so
	# the absent record is never empty and every sealed town in the corpus
	# published `hero_courtyard_bridges = 1` next to its own
	# `courtyard_bridges = 0` — the two keys are the same fact from two emitters
	# and they disagreed. The predicate below is the one the feature solver's
	# bridge-house reservation uses: a court the beam really selected has exactly
	# one owner parcel, the sentinel has none.
	#
	# This changes ONE advisory integer, 1 -> 0, in the audit of every town that
	# has no court, which today is all of them. It also makes the first term of
	# `short_hero_features` live for the first time — with no consequence, and
	# that is measured rather than argued: `skywalks` is 0 against a profile
	# minimum of 1..3 on all 24 corpus towns, so the disjunction was already true
	# everywhere by its third term and stays true. The identity probe over all 24
	# records is what proves the diff is that one integer and nothing else.

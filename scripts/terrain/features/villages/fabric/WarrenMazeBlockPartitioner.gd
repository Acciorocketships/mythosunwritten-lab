## Translator from a sealed WarrenMazeSourcePlan's PLOTS into the parcel
## contract construction already consumes. The maze decided the public graph,
## the plot planner decided the town; nothing here enumerates, scores, or
## grows an alternative partition.
##
## One HOUSE plot becomes ONE sealed WarrenBuildingParcel -- the largest
## rectangle inside that plot which can carry its own door -- and the cells
## the rectangle leaves over are that building's back rooms, recorded on the
## parcel plan for composition's residual-room machinery. Decks, bridges and
## assets are typed records, never parcels: a deck has no height to build, a
## bridge's door is a covered passage cell, and an ASSET is a complete
## authored building the planner already chose a recipe for (controller
## ruling, 2026-08-23). Parcelling an asset would ask the room grammar to
## invent walls for a prefab that ships with its own; composition instead
## reserves it as a prefab landmark from `maze_assets`.
##
## A plot whose door rectangle cannot seal is a GENERATOR bug -- a plot the
## planner should never have placed -- not a shape this stage may silently
## substitute or drop, so one untranslated plot fails the whole translation
## with its reason in `last_failure`.

## Is this plot's crown a SLAB rather than the authored pitched reservation?
##
## TASK C5d RULING 1 -- YES, for every HOUSE. The maze town is a tiered hill
## town and its vernacular is the flat roof: the authored one-band
## `roof.flat.*` unit on top of the storeys, and whatever band the height
## leaves over as a retained stone parapet course. Task C5c measured why this
## has to be the default rather than the exception -- THIRTEEN of the corpus's
## nineteen sweep failures, and thirteen of the seventeen that got as far as
## composition, died at a PITCHED roof gate (`macro setback roof 0 ... complete
## fallbacks were rejected`, `roof remainder ... 1-cell exposed sliver`, `roof
## campaign has no integrated dormer`), and both composition relaxations that
## would have filled the plot mass cost a sealing seed its town at one of
## them.
##
## THE HEIGHT CONTRACT IS STILL FLAT EVERYWHERE, AND TASK H2 DID NOT CHANGE
## IT. What H2 changed is which authored unit the compiler TRIES on that
## contract: `plot_prefers_pitched_roof` now says yes for every crown nothing
## stands on, so the ordinary town is pitched and the flat plate survives
## under load and walkable use. The massing, the storey count and the roof
## base band are the flat ones either way -- that is exactly why the pitched
## population could grow without reopening a single composition gate.
##
## The height contract is only ever RELAXED by this: a flat parcel wants one
## storey and one band of slab where a pitched one wants whole storeys plus
## the two-band reservation, and on the even heights the planner produces both
## rules give the same storey count and the same roof base band. No house
## changes shape; its crown changes.
##
## Maze-only by construction -- this file translates a `WarrenMazeSourcePlan`
## and nothing else, so no legacy parcel can reach it. The old reading
## (tiered, or something occupying the plot's own columns at its top band)
## stays as the answer for a non-house plot.
##
## THE ONE OWNER OF THE RULE. The translator decides a parcel's `flat_roof`
## with it and `WarrenVolumetricSolver` asks it twice more -- to retain a stack
## parent's slab before composition, and to bound a plot's own roof band span
## in the mass audit -- so three readings of "this crown is a slab" can never
## drift apart. What it is NOT is a claim that anybody can stand up there:
## `plot_crown_carries_public_realm` answers that, and the two parted company
## the moment every house became slab-crowned.
## TASK E4 FIX 1, IMPORTANT 1. The ROOF BAND SPAN of one plot as `[x, y)`, and
## an EMPTY span (`x == y`) for a plot that has none. A flat-roofed plot keeps
## `[flat_roof_base_band, top)` -- the authored one-band `roof.flat.*` slab
## plus, on an even height, its stone parapet course; every other house plot
## keeps the authored pitched reservation `[top - ROOF_RESERVATION_BANDS,
## top)`. House plots only: an asset carries its own crown, a bridge is one
## storey of deck, and a deck has no height at all.
##
## Stated here, where `plot_is_flat_roofed` already lives, because THREE
## readers now need the same answer and two of them used to infer it:
## `WarrenVolumetricSolver._maze_plot_roof_cells` (which owned this
## derivation), the same file's stone TRIM, and
## `WarrenSpatialFabricCompiler.maze_stone_band_profile`, which must tell a
## by-design roof band apart from a building the composition never roomed
## before it may call a stone face either.

## TASK H2 -- PITCHED IS THE DEFAULT CROWN. May this house have a pitched
## roof?  YES, unless something stands on its plate.
##
## One question now, and it is the plot model's own: is this crown FREE. A
## crown is free when nothing the town builds occupies or walks it -- no
## stacked child (`stack_parent_ids`), no upper street and no other plot in
## its own columns at its top band (`plot_crown_carries_public_realm`, which
## is `tiered or not roofed` and is the single owner of that reading). A house
## whose crown is free gets the authored pitched shell; a house carrying load
## or walkable use keeps the plank plate C5e gave it and Task H2 dresses.
##
## SUPERSEDES TASK C5d RULING 2, on the user's binding direction at the G2
## review gate ("a quaint medieval village", not a fortress). C5d asked two
## more things and both are withdrawn:
##
##  - the GEOMETRIC half -- the plot's top strictly above every 4-neighbour
##    plot top and every adjacent street band. It existed because an authored
##    eave overhangs the footprint by a cell, and it selected exactly the
##    freestanding house at the top of its block: 31 pitched crowns in 291
##    across the review corpus, which is the roof sea the user rejected. What
##    it was really protecting against is measured downstream anyway --
##    `compile_roof_units` proves every preferred shell with
##    `_unit_touches_public_air` against the real grid and `probe.add_unit`
##    against the real neighbours, and counts the refusal
##    (`maze_pitched_refused_count`) before falling back to the slab. An
##    estimate in front of a measurement is only a way of refusing crowns the
##    measurement would have allowed.
##  - the SEEDED half -- one bit of the lattice hash, so half the eligible
##    crowns asked. A coin belongs on a decision with two good answers; after
##    the direction above there is one, and the flat crowns that remain are
##    the loaded and walked ones rather than a random half.
##
## Still only a PREFERENCE, and that is unchanged: the compiler measures the
## authored unit against its real neighbours and falls back to the slab,
## counting the refusal, whenever it would displace or halo-conflict.

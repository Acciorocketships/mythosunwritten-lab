class_name WarrenMassif
extends RefCounted

## Terraced solid city mass: per-column occupiable band interval. The public
## realm is carved FROM this object; it never grows to meet a route.
##
## "Solid" is an invariant seal() actually checks, not just a naming
## convention: a builder bug that fragments the footprint (see
## WarrenMassifBuilder's fix-round-1 history) must fail here, not silently
## pass through as a solid mass with holes in it.

## Inhabited bands a terrace carries: MAX_TERRACE_STOREYS storeys plus one
## roof reservation, in WarrenBuildingParcel's units. Written out rather than
## imported so this class stays free of the parcel vocabulary; a test pins the
## arithmetic so the two cannot drift.
##
## The massif is now the complete inhabited construction envelope, grounded on
## the real terrain.  Eight storeys at the crown are enough to make a compact
## town read as a mountain while still fitting StaggeredFabricCompiler's finite
## stack vocabulary.  The final two bands are the explicit roof reservation.
## Nothing below this interval is a hidden stone substrate: bearing_at() is the
## sampled terrain on every column.
const MAX_TERRACE_STOREYS := 8
const BUILDABLE_LAYER_BANDS := 18

## Bands of continuous mass a street cell needs beside it before the plan calls
## it ADDRESSED, for towns cut from this class. Route-first keeps
## WarrenVolumePlan.MIN_ADDRESS_BUILDING_BANDS unchanged at six; the envelope
## carries the number so the two modes cannot drift and neither has to know
## about the other (WarrenVolumeEnvelope.address_bands).
##
## Six continuous bands beside a street prove that its wall belongs to a real
## two-storey-plus-roof building.  The restored deep envelope can satisfy this
## original standard even while the public route climbs through it.
const ADDRESS_BANDS := 6

## At least two ground-arcade cells must pass beneath the climbing itinerary.
## This makes overhead streets a plan fact instead of an optional decoration.
const UPPER_ROUTE_CROSSOVERS := 2

## Bands of stone a house cut from this class may stand on, carried to the
## parcel stage as WarrenVolumeEnvelope.plinth_budget_bands. Route-first keeps
## the field at zero and is byte-identical.
##
## ONE STOREY, which is the reviewer's own unit for this: "stone should only be
## used sparingly to make a house one storey taller" (ledger line 182), softened
## at line 191 to "sparing visible stone is fine where purposeful". A storey is
## WarrenBuildingParcel.STOREY_BANDS = 2 bands, so two is the whole allowance and
## a taller step is not a plinth but the masonry terrace-farm rounds 2-3
## rejected.
##
## WHAT IT BUYS, measured. A house's stack has to meet its address on a whole
## STOREY_BANDS boundary. With no budget the only way to make the arithmetic
## work is to drop the support one band BELOW the ground the house stands on --
## which is where 211 of 424 mass-first houses were found buried exactly one
## band, against zero plinths and only five footprints straddling a real step
## (task-23-report §4). The parity is a fact about the address, not about the
## hill, and the honest place to spend it is a course of stone under the house
## rather than a storey of it underground.

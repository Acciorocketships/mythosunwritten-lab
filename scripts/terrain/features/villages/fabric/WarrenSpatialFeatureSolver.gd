## TASK E3 RULING 1 MEASURED THE MAZE OUTCROPPING FAMILY AND SHIPPED NOTHING.
##
## `WarrenVillageScaleProfile.cantilever_range` is `Vector2i.ZERO` on every
## scale, which switches the whole family off: measured over the 24-town flat
## corpus, `room_outcropping_count` and
## `vertical_floorplate_outcropping_count` are **0 on every town**. The
## milestone asks for them back ("more outcroppings like we had before"), so a
## maze-only target (compact 2, standard 3, large 4, grand 5) was wired into
## `desired_extra_diagonal` below -- the profile itself deliberately untouched,
## since `cantilever_range` is part of `deterministic_signature` and every
## searched town reads it. Two measurements followed and both refuse the
## feature:
##
##   * as written, the corpus fell 24/24 -> 22/24. `3/compact` and
##     `11/compact` each reserved one diagonal corner-wrap annex and then died
##     at `room ...partNN.room00 failed measured phase selection: visual
##     envelope`, because `_tower_annex_clears_room_envelopes` exempts the
##     annex's whole SOURCE LINEAGE -- right for a searched building whose
##     parts are composed to interlock, wrong for a maze lineage whose parts
##     are the rectangles one plot was cut into.
##   * narrowing that exemption to the annex's own parent ROOM restored
##     24/24 and then selected **zero** annexes on all 24 towns.
##
## The pool is the reason for both. `_diagonal_outcrop_target_pool` takes only
## `tower`-kind rooms on an upper storey, and a maze town offers ONE such
## parcel (measured `target_source_count: 1`, `eligible_endpoint_count: 4`,
## every theme-matching attempt refused by `_skywalk_body_fits_grid`). The pool
## grows with taller houses, and `WarrenPlotPlanner.STOREY_BUDGET` records why
## taller houses could not be shipped either. A real maze outcropping needs
## either that vocabulary work or the bracketed-jetty producer
## `WarrenVolumetricSolver._residual_bridge_span` never got -- it is read for
## `is_bracketed_jetty` in three places and set in none. NEITHER EXPERIMENT IS
## SHIPPED: `cantilever_range` still decides the target, and it is zero.
##
## TASK E3b RE-APPLIED BOTH ON TOP OF THE SHIPPED TALLER HOUSES AND REVERTED
## THEM AGAIN, and the second measurement replaces E3's diagnosis with a
## stronger one. The pool did grow exactly as E3 predicted -- `12/standard`
## goes `target_source_count` 1 -> **7**, `eligible_endpoint_count` 4 -> **28**,
## `recipe_attempt_count` 24 -> **168** -- and the outcome is still **zero
## candidates**, because **53 of those attempts die at
## `_skywalk_body_fits_grid` and none at the room envelope**
## (`room_envelope_rejection_count: 0`, so the narrowed lineage exemption is
## not what refuses them either).
##
## THE REASON IS THE TOWN, NOT THE QUOTA. A diagonal annex needs OUTSIDE or
## ALLOCATABLE cells beside an upper room, and a town CARVED OUT OF A MOUNTAIN
## has none: every cell beside a house is another plot's private volume, the
## retained rock the town was cut from, or a street's public air, and
## `_skywalk_body_fits_grid` admits none of the three. No quota, pool or
## exemption can produce a diagonal corner outcropping here; only mass the
## carver deliberately RETAINED over a void can carry one, which is exactly
## what a bridge span is. That is why Task E3b spent its outcropping ruling on
## the bracketed jetty (`WarrenVolumetricSolver._residual_bridge_span`, now
## with a producer) instead of on this family.

	## Residual bridge rooms with two flanks need no added construction. A room
	## admitted from one exact flank is different: its sealed room audit carries
	## the measured bracket courses selected with the topology, and this adapter
	## reserves those attachments before balconies or facade relief can spend the
	## same envelope.
	##
	## FIX ROUND 1, IMPORTANT 2 -- THIS IS A TOWN-FAILING PATH, AND IT IS NEW.
	##
	## Until Task E3b nothing ever set `bridge_support_records`, so this loop
	## never ran and the function could not refuse anything. It runs now, and a
	## bracket conflict below returns empty with `last_failure` set, which
	## `solve` turns into a rejected town. Task E3b's report claimed "no new
	## rejection path"; that claim was wrong about this function and is
	## corrected in its fix report.
	##
	## THE FAILURE IS KEPT BECAUSE A GRACEFUL RELEASE IS NOT AVAILABLE HERE,
	## and the reason is that the decision was already taken two stages up. By
	## the time this runs the jetty room is STAMPED and its bearing contract is
	## committed: `WarrenSpatialFabricCompiler._room_recipe_id` reads
	## `bridge_is_bracketed_jetty` off the room audit and returns a
	## `room.jetty.*` shell whose `bearing_parent_count` is 1. Skipping the
	## reservation would leave that shell standing on one flank with no course
	## beneath it -- precisely the "box pasted on a facade" the volumetric
	## solver's own comment forbids -- and clearing the flag instead would send
	## the compiler to `room.bridge.*`, which demands two bearing parents this
	## span does not have. Neither is a release; both are a worse town.
	##
	## The releasable half of this risk is handled where it IS releasable:
	## `WarrenVolumetricSolver._bridge_jetty_support_records` now refuses a
	## course of more than one record at STAMP time, because
	## `frontier_gateway_support` is a one-record feature by contract and such
	## a span would otherwise reach the compiler and fail there. What is left
	## is a genuine conflict with a feature reserved BEFORE this pass (markets,
	## courtyards, skywalks, gateways, landmarks), which cannot be foreseen at
	## stamp time. The three sibling adapters that also reserve construction
	## under an already-stamped room -- frontier gateway, arcade overhang and
	## room overhang -- all fail the town on the same conflict for the same
	## reason, so this is the house idiom rather than a new one; what is new is
	## that a maze town can now reach it.

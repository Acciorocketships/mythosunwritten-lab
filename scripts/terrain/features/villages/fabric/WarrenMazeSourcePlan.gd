##
##   1. the band below the floor is solid -- rock, a retained tunnel-roof
##      slab, or another plot's top (solid_at answers all three),
##   2. no carved air stands in the MIN_HOUSE_BANDS of clearance above it, and
##   3. the floor stands ON this column's terrain rather than inside it.
##
## Rule 2 is CLEARANCE, not "above every passage in this column" (controller
## ruling, 2026-08-22): a house tiered under an upper street has that street's
## own band as its top and must stay legal. Its consequence at the bottom end
## is that a plot can never sit AT a passage's headroom top -- the band below
## it would be carved -- so a tunnel-roof or bridge plot sits one band higher,
## on the retained roof slab that is its rock.
##
## Rule 3 is rule 1's other half, and it only exists once the ground is not
## flat (task D1). `solid_at` answers TRUE for every band below
## `massif.base_at` -- terrain is untouched sample, and that is what lets a
## house fronting a grade street stand at `floor == base_at` -- so rule 1
## alone is satisfied vacuously at ANY depth: a footprint that reaches from a

## three bands inside the bank. Measured on the terrace-step fixture, that is

## ("footprint has no mass, no bearing, or an illegal height here", 16 of 24
## corpus towns). A buried column is not a house the composition can build,
## so the model refuses the column here and `WarrenPlotPlanner._join` grows

## PHASE E's exit metric, and the user's first binding direction (2026-08-24)
## as a number: stone belongs in the bottom one or two storeys of whatever
## stands beside it, "not everywhere". `exterior_rock_ratio` above says how
## MUCH of the skin is stone and says nothing at all about WHERE it stands, so
## it cannot see the difference between a coursed retaining base under every
## street and the same tonnage piled six storeys up as bare mountain. This
## does, and it replaces the flat ratio as the pinned exit metric; the flat
## ratio stays an audit fact beside it.
##
## THE FACES. Every exterior face of derived STONE -- a solid cell in the
## massif's own band range that no plot claims -- taken over
## STONE_FACE_OFFSETS, so four sides and two caps, exactly the shell
## `SettlementFabricAssembler.exposed_maze_stone_faces` skins downstream. A
## face is exterior when the neighbour across it is not solid. The ONE
## exception mirrors the assembler's own: a sky-facing cap under a passage
## walk cell is the street's planked floor, which draws itself, so it is no
## more part of the stone skin here than it is there. Counting FACES rather
## than cells is what makes a four-sided tower of rock cost four times a
## retaining course of the same height.
##
## THE DATUM. Each face is placed against `local_public_datum` for its own
## column and band -- the nearest street or deck floor within
## PUBLIC_DATUM_RADIUS columns, or its own terrain where none is in range --
## and its band offset is `band - datum`. Local, because a terraced town has
## no single ground: the retaining bank under an upper street is LOW stone
## even where it stands eight bands over the market, and reading the whole
## town against one datum would count the terracing task E3 shipped as a
## defect.
##
## `{faces, low_faces, high_faces, high_face_ratio, band_histogram,
## storey_histogram, grounded_faces, raised_shoulder_faces,
## raised_shoulder_high_faces, min_offset, max_offset}`, with
## `high_face_ratio = high/faces` the pinned number (0.0 for a town with no
## stone skin at all) and `high` meaning `offset > LOW_STONE_BANDS`. Both
## histograms are keyed in ascending order, so `str()` of one is a stable
## printable record. `raised_shoulder_high_faces` is task E4 ruling 2's own
## measurement: how much of the high stone stands on a column whose sealed
## shoulder grew ABOVE its massif envelope (`raised_shoulder_columns`).
##
## Seal records the whole dictionary under
## `audit["exterior_stone_band_profile"]`. Like the flat ratio, it is only
## worth measuring once the sealed rock shoulders exist.

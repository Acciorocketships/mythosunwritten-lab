##   standing in a bank taller than STONE_BUDGET_BANDS: a bank that tall is
##   the HILLSIDE the town is cut into, and coursed ashlar there is the

## decision this task may not take, so the repeat is broken by PLACEMENT
## instead, seeded off the panel's own coordinates so the payload stays a pure

##   stands proud of it all vary, so no two neighbours share a lobe line.
##
## THE BOUNDS ARE A COVERAGE PROOF, NOT A TASTE. A slit between two shards
## does not show rock behind it -- the skin is a SHELL, so it shows the sky
## through the mountain. Two conditions, both on the WORST roll:
##
## * a lone shard must close its own cell by itself, because the neighbouring
##   cell may own no panel at all:
##       1.5 x (CROSS_SCALE - CROSS_JITTER) >= 0.75 + SLIDE
##       1.5 x 0.62 = 0.930 >= 0.870, margin 0.060 m;
## * two neighbours sliding APART must still overlap, since their slides can
##   differ by twice SLIDE:
##       3.0 x (CROSS_SCALE - CROSS_JITTER) >= 1.5 + 2 x SLIDE
##       3.0 x 0.62 = 1.860 >= 1.740, margin 0.120 m.
##
## The first pass failed both (0.16 jitter with a 0.24 slide leaves 0.30 m of
## a cell open on the worst pair) and the comment here claimed otherwise; the
## numbers are now written out so the claim is checkable. The rise is bounded
## the same way -- 4.0 x (1 - RISE_JITTER) = 3.36 m still covers the 3 m
## course -- and the TOP is pinned whatever the roll, because a bank's rim is
## where the green cap begins and may not move.
##
## TASK H2c FIX 2, IMPORTANT 1 -- WHICH PANELS THAT 3.36 m COVERS. The bound
## above is a bound on the JITTER, so it holds for every panel whose rise is
## the roll: the worst roll is 0.84, the module hangs 4.0 x 0.84 = 3.36 m from
## its pinned top, and the two-band course under that top is 2 x CELL_SIZE =
## 3.0 m. It does NOT hold for a panel the tail clamp shortens -- a clamped
## rise is not drawn from [0.84, 1.16] at all and can be as little as
## NATURAL_ROCK_CUT_MIN_RISE = 0.375, which covers one band and not two. Those

##
## Giving the shard a collider turned a bulge the eye could see into one a body

## of towns had a route component CUT APART -- a crossing between two walked
## cells with no way round it. The remedy the controller ruled for is the one a
## hill town's masons would have used: where the path passes, the rock is cut
## back. Not the collider (visible rock a body walks through is a lie), and not
## a global relief shave (the strata read is right everywhere it is not in the
## way).
##
## THE ARITHMETIC, because the clamp is derived and not chosen. The shard's nose
## plane is at local z = 1.0 (`kaykit_cliff_wall` is AABB z 0.25 -> 1.0) and its
## origin sits `NATURAL_ROCK_FACE_DEPTH_CENTRE` behind the boundary, so the nose

## THE SECOND HALF OF THE CUT: THE TAIL, not the nose.
##
## Stand-off alone did not clear the corpus, and the probe that found out why
## (`h2c-evidence/pinch_probe.gd`) is worth reading before touching any of this.
## The panels still shutting streets after the first cut were not the facing
## lobes the pinch arithmetic models. They were panels whose OWN FACE PLANE the
## street crosses, one to three courses above it: the shard clads a 1.5 m band
## but is 4 m tall, the design buries the excess "in the mass below", and where
## the mass below is an open street the excess hangs into it instead. Such a
## panel does not LEAN into the corridor, it crosses the whole of it -- the
## probe reads 1.500 m of a 1.500 m boundary covered -- so no stand-off reaches
## it, and pulling it back only moves the wall.
##
## What reaches it is the module's own RISE, which is the one dial that moves
## its bottom edge: the top is pinned (a bank's rim is where the green cap
## begins) and the module hangs `(TOP + BASE) x rise` below it. Clearing a body
## walking `g` bands underneath needs
##
##     (g + 1) x CELL_SIZE - (TOP + BASE) x rise >= HEADROOM
##
## and the rise may not fall below what covers the panel's own BAND, or the
## skin opens a slit and shows sky through the mountain:
##
##     (TOP + BASE) x rise >= CELL_SIZE      ->  rise >= 0.375
##
## At g = 3 that allows rise <= 0.917 and the tail lifts clear. At g = 2 it
## demands 0.542 and at g = 1 it demands 0.167 -- and 0.167 is below the
## coverage floor, so at g = 1 there is NO rise that both clads the band and
## clears the street. Those crossings pass a mass corner at head height and no
## cladding of any material can open them; they are counted, not silenced.
##
## TASK H2c FIX 2, IMPORTANT 1 -- THE FLOOR IS A BAND AND A PANEL CLADS A
## COURSE, SO HERE IS THE REST OF THE PROOF. `maze_stone_faces` keeps one panel
## per STONE_COURSE_BANDS = 2 exposed bands, so the panel at band y clads the
## COURSE {y, y - 1} whenever band y - 1's face is exposed too. A floor of one
## CELL_SIZE therefore proves less than it looks: 0.375 covers band y and
## nothing under it. The three cases the clamp can be in, and what closes each:
##
## * g = 3 -- ARITHMETIC ALONE. The ceiling is 0.9165, the module hangs
##   4.0 x 0.9165 = 3.666 m, and the course is 3.0 m. Fully clad, no
##   dependency.
## * g = 2 -- THE ONE THAT LEANS ON `blocked = 0`. The ceiling is 0.5415 and
##   the module hangs 2.166 m, which is 0.834 m short of the course. That is a
##   slit IF band y - 1 carries an exposed face. It cannot, while the corpus
##   measures `blocked = 0`: for that face to exist, cell (x, y-1, z) must be
##   maze stone, and it sits directly on the walked cell (x, y-2, z) that fired
##   the clamp. Stone directly over a walked cell has an exposed DOWN face --
##   the neighbour below is neither retained nor solid -- so `maze_stone_faces`
##   emits a floor-facing cap there, `maze_skin_treatments` makes it MASONRY
##   (only an UP cap can be green), and `_maze_stone_transform` lays that 3 m
##   slab flat and sinks it by STONE_CAP_HALF_DEPTH so its rock face is FLUSH
##   with the boundary. The slab spans the cell's whole footprint and the cell
##   is 1.5 m tall against a body that needs NATURAL_ROCK_CUT_HEADROOM =
##   2.334 m, so the capsule meets it at every offset and that walked cell
##   would count `blocked`. The 48-town matrix measures `blocked = 0`, so the
##   configuration is not in the corpus and the clamped panel's course is one
##   band.
## * g = 1 -- band y - 1 IS the street, so the course is one band and 0.375
##   clads it exactly. This case is also `maze_natural_face_tail_is_clearable`
##   false and is published as `maze_skin_cut_tail_unclearable_count`, measured
##   0 corpus-wide, so it does not arise either.
##
## THE DEPENDENCY IS LOAD-BEARING AND IT IS ON A MEASURED NUMBER, not on a
## construction. If `blocked` ever leaves zero, this floor stops being sound at
## g = 2 and has to be re-derived -- the honest fix then is 2 x CELL_SIZE /
## (TOP + BASE) = 0.75, which is why that number is NOT the floor today: it
## would make g = 2 unclearable and course the crossing over to masonry, which
## is a heavier answer than the geometry needs.
##
## TASK I1 -- THE PREMISE WENT FALSE, AND WAS PUT BACK RATHER THAN PAID FOR.
## This is the history, because a proof standing on a measurement should carry
## the day that measurement moved. Task I1 halved every footprint and its first
## 48-town matrix measured `blocked = 3`: three walked cells in three towns
## admitting no capsule, which is exactly the condition written above. The floor
## was NOT raised to 0.75. The three cells were read one at a time
## (`i1f1/probe-before.log`) and not one of them was the g = 2 configuration
## this proof rules out -- in all three the module in the street was a
## HORIZONTAL cap oversailing its own run, a defect on an axis neither clamp
## looked at. Extending the trim machinery to that axis
## (`maze_stone_cap_juts_over_walk`) took all three cells and all four of their
## shut crossings back to free, and the matrix measures `blocked = 0` again.
##
## So the premise is measured-true on the shipped tree, by the same corpus and
## the same physics query it was true by before -- and it is now true with one
## more mechanism holding it up rather than one fewer. The contingency above
## still stands for the next time.

## TASK I4 ROUND 5, ITEM 4 -- AND THIS CONSTANT IS NOT THE "gaps between the

## lattice exactly and that is measured three ways: the module's mesh is a flat
## 4 x 4 grid spanning -1.5 to +1.5 with no bevel and no inset (16 vertices, 18
## triangles); inflating every plate by 8 per cent leaves the lines exactly where
## they were; and the transforms abut to the micron by construction. What the
## lines really are is named in the round-5 report -- a BUILDING UNIT's own floor
## board, 0.161 m thick, standing with its base ON the lawn's plane one band up,
## so it lies over the turf rather than beside it. Lifting the quad to hide it
## was tried at 0.006, 0.045 and 0.075 m and none of them clears a 0.161 m board;
## 0.30 m does, and a lawn standing a foot proud of its own ground is not a fix.
## The producer is a cell the garden treatment should not have called a yard at
## all -- 6 to 67 garden cells a town lie under a room's envelope one band up,

## TASK I4 ROUND 6 -- THE PIECES THAT NEED TWO CELLS, and the whole answer to

## Round 5 measured them and left them out; this round merges the free boxes of a
## PAIR of boundary cells and the adjacent-differs rule treats the pair as one
## occupant, so the boundary comes back with MORE variety rather than less.
##
## The three, measured off the descriptors as half-extents about each piece's own
## origin (the same reading DECOR_CLEARANCE takes, and the same reason -- these
## are authored off-centre):
##
## * `lpfv.fabric.prop.bench.02` -- 1.031 x 0.208. Fits a pair's 1.5 x 0.75 with
##   0.47 m to spare along the run.
## * `lpfv.fabric.prop.bench.01` -- 1.153 x 0.219. The longer bench of the two.
## * `lpfv.fabric.prop.lantern.post.02` -- 1.234 x 0.277. The post stands on its
##   own centre and the ARM reaches 1.234 m to one side, which is why the
##   symmetric bound is the arm's and not half the piece's width.

##
## THE CENTRE FEATURE is one of three authored village pieces, chosen by seed,

##   2.237/1.599, which clears the same 2.250 m by 13 mm.
## * `lpfv.tree.05`   -- 2.498 x 5.991 x 2.142, 1 collider. Half-extents
##   1.249/1.071 against the 1.500 m half of a 2 x 2-cell block, so the tree is
##   also the answer where only a 2 x 2 is clear.

## TASK I4 ROUND 5, ITEM 1 -- "one of the plants is glitched into the wall", and
## the cause is that A LATTICE CELL IS NOT FREE SPACE.
##
## `maze_garden_dressing` stood every piece on its cell's own centre and bounded
## it by the CELL: "turned so it CANNOT reach a neighbour -- the broadest
## measures 0.951 m, whose worst rotated half-extent is 0.639 m against the
## cell's own 0.750 m". Every number in that sentence is right and the sentence
## is still wrong, because the thing a planter really meets is not the lattice
## plane at 0.750 m, it is the BUILT SURFACE standing in front of it:
##
## * a COURSED MASONRY panel straddles its boundary -- origin ON the plane,
##   0.664 m deep -- so it occupies STONE_CAP_HALF_DEPTH = 0.332 m of the cell on
##   EITHER side of it, its own and its neighbour's;
## * a TIMBER FACADE panel is pinned by its outer face to the boundary and
##   occupies the outer FACADE_CELL_DEPTH = 0.553 m of ITS OWN column (the number
##   `_maze_facade_transform` already states: "it occupies the outer 0.553 m,
##   which leaves 0.947 m of a 1.5 m cell");
## * a BUILDING's own wall across the boundary is a room unit's module, and the
##   deepest in the vocabulary is the double door leaf at 0.563 m from the plane
##   (`sfv.fabric.wall.wood.door.closed.001`, measured z -0.563 to +0.508).
##
## So the free half-width of an edge cell is 0.750 m minus whichever of those is
## standing there -- 0.418 m against coursed stone, 0.197 m against a facade,
## 0.187 m against a door -- and a 1.208 m planter centred on that cell reaches
## 0.186 m into the stone and 0.407 m into the timber. Measured on the review

## TASK I4 ROUND 5, ITEM 2 -- "the market stall is not one of the stocked ones;
## it is empty. we should use the stocked ones."
##
## THE CATALOGUE'S STOCKED STALLS DO NOT FIT, and that is a measurement rather
## than a preference. `sfm.stall.variant.001` -- the empty canopy the square
## stands today -- is 4.474 x 3.199 m, which clears the 4.5 m of a 3 x 3-cell
## plaza block by 13 mm and the 4.5 m of a three-cell perimeter window by the
## same. The SMALLEST genuinely stocked prefab in the bake is
## `sfm.stall.fish.001` at 5.113 x 3.415 (half-width 2.718 against 2.250), and
## the rest run to 7.6 m; every one of them would hang half a metre past the
## block it stands in, over the very edge cells item 1 above is about, and the
## wide ones bake a single CONCAVE hull where the canopy pool bakes seven boxes.
##
## SO THE CANOPY IS STOCKED INSTEAD OF REPLACED, which is this project's own
## established answer rather than a new one: `SettlementFabricProgram`'s
## `_covered_market_recipe` already builds "one exact 6 x 3 m covered bazaar" by
## standing the reviewed stocked counter and the hanging goods under a bare
## canopy from `COVERED_MARKET_CANOPIES`. This is that composition, done in the
## fabric for the two canopies this file sites itself -- the square's centre
## feature and the perimeter frontage.
##
## THE STATIONS ARE MEASURED OFF THE CANOPY'S OWN SEVEN COLLIDER BOXES. Four
## posts, 0.30 m square, at (+-2.08, +-1.12); the canopy and its two valances
## from y = 4.21 up. The GROUND between the posts is therefore clear from
## x = -1.93 to +1.93 and z = -0.97 to +0.97, and every station that stands on
## the ground is inside that. The HANGING station is not and does not need to
## be: it is 3.9 m up, well over the posts' own 1.12 m half-depth, and what
## bounds it is the cloth above it rather than the frame below -- which is the
## bound round 5 never asserted and `maze_stall_hanging_station` now does.
## (r4+r5 review, minor 3.)
##
## * the STOCKED COUNTER (`sfm.table.fishmonger.001`, 2.064 x 1.406 with its
##   fish, its crate and its board) stands at z = +0.45, so it spans x +-1.032
##   and z -0.359 to +1.259 -- clear of both post rows in x;
## * THREE GOODS stand in a row at z = -0.95, at x = -1.45, 0.00 and +1.45, each
##   at most 0.45 m across, so the widest of them runs 1.00 to 1.90 in x against
##   the post's own 1.93 and never touches the counter;
##
## WHICH SIDE IS THE FRONT is a fact about the CANOPY's own local axes and this
## file's two siting rules disagree about it, so neither station is described as
## front or back any more. `maze_perimeter_frontage` turns each module's
## authored local +Z outward (see its own note), which puts the counter at
## z = +0.45 on the MEADOW side of a perimeter stall and the three goods against
## the town wall; the square's centre feature takes a seeded quarter turn and so
## faces wherever the roll put it. Both compositions are inside the canopy and
## both read as a stocked stall; what is not defensible is a comment claiming a
## front the geometry does not have. (r4+r5 review, minor 2.)
## * the HANGING GOODS (`sfm.stall.veg_string.001`) hang from y = 3.90 down to
##   2.64, which is above the 2.244 m a body needs -- the same bound
##   `_covered_market_recipe` states for its own two attachments.
##
## TASK I4 ROUND 6 -- AND THE STATION IS PER CANOPY, because the two canopies are
## not the same piece and round 5 measured only one of them. The r4+r5 review
## caught it: `sfv.fabric.awning.blue.001` rises 3.4910 m and the string hung
## from 3.9 spans y 2.635 -> 3.9004, so its top stood 0.4094 m IN OPEN AIR above
## the cloth -- on 18 of 18 awnings on the review towns and on the order of 150
## across the matrix, a defect this file's own item-2 fix introduced.
##
## THE AWNING CANNOT CARRY A STRING AT ALL, and the arithmetic is what says so
## rather than a preference. The string is 1.2653 m long with its top 0.0004 m
## over its own origin, so a station that keeps the top under the cloth needs
## `y <= 3.4906` and one that keeps the foot over a body's head needs
## `y >= 2.244 + 1.2649 = 3.5089`. There is no such y. An awning is therefore
## stocked with its counter and its three goods and hangs nothing, which is
## `maze_stall_hanging_station` returning nothing rather than a number nobody
## checked.

## THE VOCABULARY IS MEASURED, not chosen, and every number below is read off
## the descriptor rather than assumed -- mirrored against them by

##
## * `sfm.stall.variant.001`  -- 4.474 x 4.019 x 3.199, 7 colliders. The market
##   stall the square already stands one of in its middle.
## * `sfv.fabric.awning.blue.001` -- 4.241 x 3.491 x 3.030, 0 colliders. A
##   complete framed awning, which is the lean-to end of the vocabulary.
## * `sfm.table.fishmonger.001` -- 2.064 x 1.343 x 1.406, 5 colliders.
## * `lpfv.fabric.prop.barrel.01` -- 0.899 x 1.030 x 0.899, 0 colliders.
##
## THE WINDOW IS THREE CELLS because the two wide pieces are 4.474 m and
## 4.241 m against 4.5 m of lattice -- 13 mm and 130 mm of slack. Two cells hold
## the table with 0.94 m to spare and one cell holds a barrel.
##
## BACK REACHES, so a piece's VISIBLE back plane lands on the wall it fronts:
## `-measured_aabb.position.z` for the authored local +Z frontage. Most pieces
## are centred and this equals half-depth; the fishmonger's table is not, and a
## half-size offset left 0.106 m of its mesh behind the cleared wall plane.
##
## ROUND-2 CORRECTION -- "AND NOTHING REACHES INTO THE MASS" WAS AN ABSOLUTE AND
## IS NOT TRUE. These are half the VISUAL extent, and the market stall's baked
## collider is deeper than its geometry: the hull reaches 1.831 m out from its
## own origin against the 1.599 m this table pushes it, so 0.231 m of collider
## stands BEHIND the wall plane, inside the town's own mass. It is harmless --
## the cells it occupies are solid, nothing walks there, and no rule in this file
## measures anything from a frontage's back plane -- and the alternative is
## worse: pushing the piece out by the collider's half-depth instead would float
## the visible stall 0.23 m off the wall it is meant to lean on. The 0.231 m is
## footprint mass and is named here so the next reader does not rediscover it as
## a bug. What the collider hull DOES govern is the clearance envelope in front
## of the piece -- see PERIMETER_FRONTAGE_CLEARANCE, which takes the larger of
## the two readings per axis for exactly this reason.

## deeper than the thing you can see. The awning and the barrel bake NO collider
## at all, so for those the geometry is the whole of it. Both readings matter and
## the envelope is the larger of them per axis: a body may not walk through a
## stall's frame, and it may not walk through an awning's canopy either.
##
## Per asset, as (HALF-WIDTH, RISE, REACH) in metres:
##
## * HALF-WIDTH -- how far the piece reaches to EITHER side of the window's
##   centre, which is the larger of its two lateral extents and not half its
##   size: `sfm.table.fishmonger.001` is authored off-centre (x runs -0.980 to
##   +1.084), so half its width would understate the end it really hangs past;
## * RISE -- how far it stands above the foot band's floor, which every module in
##   the pool is authored from;
## * REACH -- how far it reaches out from the WALL PLANE: the placement offset
##   `PERIMETER_FRONTAGE_DEPTH` plus its own outward half-extent, so the stall's
##   1.599 + 1.831 = 3.430 m is measured from the boundary the back plane lands

## TASK I4 ROUND 8, PART 1 -- HOW FAR A FRONTAGE STANDS OFF A CLAD WALL, and why
## the number is the skin's own depth rather than a taste.
##
## `PERIMETER_FRONTAGE_DEPTH` pushes each piece out by its own measured
## half-depth so its VISIBLE BACK PLANE lands on the wall it fronts -- and the
## wall that rule means is the LATTICE BOUNDARY. Where the town's edge is a
## BUILDING that is exactly right. Where it is the retained mass, the boundary is
## not the wall: a coursed panel, a facade storey or a rock shard stands in front
## of it, and the piece was landing its back plane inside that cladding. Measured
## on 12/compact before this round: 16 frontage and 15 stall-goods pieces sharing
## real volume with a `maze-stone` panel, the deepest 0.659 m in -- the r6
## review's buried planter one layer out, and the r7 report's concern 2.
##
## THE SAME NUMBER THE SUPPRESSION RULE USES, for the same reason
## (`MAZE_SKIN_PANEL_HALF_DEPTH`): which module a face wears is decided by
## `maze_skin_treatments`, which reads the footprint index, so a siting rule that
## asked for the ACTUAL module would decide against a shell its own outcome
## moves. The deepest of the three keeps the stand-off a pure function of the
## cell sets, and the error is one-sided -- a piece stands at most 0.221 m
## further off a masonry face than it strictly must, and never inside it.
##
## AND IT CANNOT MOVE A SITE. `_frontage_window_is_free` clears
## `ceil(reach / CELL_SIZE)` whole cells of ground in front of every window, so
## the stand-off is free exactly while
##
##     pool reach + STANDOFF <= ceil(pool reach / CELL_SIZE) x CELL_SIZE
##
## which holds for all three pools with 0.517 m, 0.935 m and 0.048 m to spare.
## `test_the_frontage_stand_off_fits_the_ground_the_gate_clears` is that

## module past its slack the pin fails here instead of silently dressing fewer

## THEY HANG ON THE CLAD MASS, which is where the blank walls are. Task I2 turned
## every tall bank face into a building storey and the corpus now carries 64-347
## of those panels per town -- the tower-like faces the reference frame's own bay

## existing structure, it moves no plot, reserves no cell and cannot cost a seal,
## where widening the compiled `facade_bay` reservation would do all three.

## Qualifying runs are selected as a deterministic maximal separated set. The
## earlier independent acceptance roll could leave a whole town with only one
## treatment kind (the fixed production seed selected nine bays and zero

## proof. Negative space now comes from the one-storey vertical separation and
## the two-panel horizontal footprint and the alternating depth, not from
## throwing valid geometry away.
## HOW HIGH A PANEL HAS TO STAND OVER A STREET, in bands measured from the
## panel's own band, and it is THREE rather than the skywalk's two because an
## outcropping hangs a course LOWER than a bridge does. The panel clads the
## course {band - 1, band}; its bearers hang SKYWALK_BEARER_DROP under the box's
## own floor at `(band - 1) x CELL_SIZE`, so the lowest timber is
## `(band - 1) x 1.5 - 0.471`.
##
## FIX 1, MINOR 8 CORRECTS THAT SUBTRACTION and the conclusion survives it. The
## first telling wrote `- 0.632`, which is the SKYWALK's number: a bridge hangs
## its corbel under a DECK, so it pays the deck's 0.161 m as well, and an
## outcropping's bearers hang straight off the box's floor line and do not. The
## real requirement against a body's 2.284 m is
## `(band - 1 - b) x 1.5 >= 2.284 + 0.471 = 2.755`, i.e. `band - b >= 2.837`,
## i.e. three bands -- the same answer the wrong constant gave, reached
## honestly. THE MARGIN IS 245 MM (`3.0 - 2.755`), not the 84 mm a bridge has;

	## descending short of its own ground. This is the "stone to make a house one
	## storey taller" the directive allows, and it is where the liked
	## wood-over-stone junction happens.
	## THE MOUNTAIN SUBSTRATE ROLE IS GONE (terrain milestone Wave 4, design
	## §3.4). `hill_substrate_walls` used to tile the riser a house stood on with
	## whole rock modules, because the fabric owned the hill and an undrawn hill
	## left its houses floating. Natural terrain now remains authoritative below
	## the plinth: the terrain mesh renders it, CliffDressing dresses its faces,
	## and the chunk collider carries it. Re-drawing it here would put a
	## masonry collider inside the terrain's own volume and rebuild the monument
	## rounds 2 and 3 rejected. The retired asset compiler no longer declares the
	## remainder either, so this function's input is already only plinths.
	##
	## TASK C5b RULING 1 ADDS THE SECOND ROLE, and only for a maze town: the
	## retained MOUNTAIN the plot model cut its streets and plots out of. That
	## hill is NOT the heightfield's -- `WarrenVolumetricSolver._retain_maze_
	## rock` claims it above each column's own terrain datum, so the terrain
	## mesh stops below it and nothing else in the pipeline draws it. Left
	## unskinned it is the render debt C5 measured: plazas on posts over
	## daylight, bored streets standing on nothing, and 47-64 building plinth
	## faces per town suppressed by mass that draws nothing. The skin is a
	## shell over the same channel, in the same module, through the same
	## transform idiom; legacy plans tag no cell and get no extra instance.

## NATURAL_ROCK_FACE_DEPTH_CENTRE (0.375 m).
##
## THE DEEPEST OF THE THREE, ON PURPOSE, AND WHAT THAT IS NOW FOR. The union
## keeps the box a pure function of the cell sets, and its error is one-sided: a
## masonry face is charged 0.221 m it does not occupy, so a rule reading it can
## only ever ask a module to stand further out of a wall than it strictly must.
##
## THAT IS SAFE FOR A STAND-OFF AND IT WAS NOT SAFE FOR A WITHDRAWAL, which is
## the r7+r8 review's I2 and the reason this docstring no longer claims both.
## `_frontage_window_offsets` uses the union and keeps it: standing a barrel
## 0.221 m further off a wall than it needs costs nothing. Round 7's suppression
## rule also used it, and three of its 66 withdrawals turned out to share NO
## volume with the cladding their towns really build -- two flowers and a tavern
## sign deleted from finished towns for a wall that is not there.
## `WarrenSpatialFabricCompiler._suppress_intruding_modules` now measures against

## height alone. The footprint index steers CAP faces, which contribute a
## fixed-depth soffit or no box at all -- so the panel boxes are the same array

	##   they are ground, and ground is green. A cap covers its own cell AND
	##   the neighbour it was paired with, so BOTH have to be unwalked -- one
	##   green plate under a street would be lawn where the pavement is.
	## * NATURAL -- a side face in a bank taller than STONE_BUDGET_BANDS. Two
	##   bands is the budget a mason's retaining wall was given; above it the
	##   face is hillside, and hillside is rock.
	## * MASONRY -- everything else: the <= 2-band retaining faces, the caps
	##   the realm walks (task C5b's "the street stands on stone"), and every
	##   floor-facing cap, which is the roof of a bored passage and is read
	##   from inside a tunnel rather than as part of the town's silhouette.
	##
	## TASK I7 -- a tall retained bank is still town fabric, never a natural
	## cliff, but cladding every course in the same white/timber module made the
	## bank read as one multi-storey skyscraper face. The vertical vocabulary is
	## now deliberately coursed: the top storey is FACADE, the next is MASONRY,
	## and they alternate down the run. Thus no two facade storeys can touch
	## vertically, stone replaces timber/white in substantial bounded places,

	##
	## ANY GROUND KEEPS IT GREEN, and that asymmetry is deliberate. The slab is

	##   the same job.
	## * IT CANNOT SHUT A STREET. The coursed masonry panel straddles its
	##   boundary and stands 0.332 m into the cell it faces; the rock shard stood
	##   0.375 m plus its relief; this stands 0.000 m. Every trim in this file

	##
	## A SITE IS FOUR FACTS, each of them a way a stall could be wrong:
	##
	## 1. THE FACE LOOKS OUT. Its column across the boundary carries no mass at
	##    any band -- open terrain rather than the next block -- so the wall
	##    behind the stall really is the town's edge.
	## 2. IT IS THE TOWN'S OWN GROUND STOREY, and that is stricter than "the
	##    lowest panel of its own column". A terrace bench three storeys up is
	##    also the lowest panel of ITS column, and the first pass put a
	##    fishmonger's table halfway up a retaining wall because of it
	##    (`i4r1/f3-big.png`). The fabric does not hold the terrain height
	##    outside its own footprint, so the one datum it can honestly stand a
	##    stall on is the band where the town's own mass reaches its lowest --
	##    which is where the massif meets the ground it was cut into.
	## 3. THE GROUND IS ONE LEVEL ACROSS THE WHOLE FRONT. Every column of the
	##    window shares one foot band, which is what "both feet on the ground"
	##    means for a piece 4.5 m wide: a stall spanning a step would float at one
	##    end and bury itself at the other.
	## 4. NOBODY WALKS THERE. No public floor and no walked cell in front of the
	##    wall, at the foot band or the one above it, so a frontage can never
	##    stand in the mouth of a street leaving the town.
	##
	## AND A FIFTH FACT SINCE ROUND 8, which is not a way a site can be wrong but a
	## way a PLACEMENT was: `skin` is `maze_skin_panel_boxes` for this same town,
	## and each site carries the `standoff` its wall's cladding costs it. Empty
	## `skin` means "no caller told me what clads this town", which reads the same
	## as an unclad edge -- every production caller passes it, and the two that do
	## not are counting sites rather than placing them. See
	## `PERIMETER_FRONTAGE_SKIN_STANDOFF`.
	##
	## The window is THREE CELLS because the vocabulary is: the market stall
	## measures 4.474 m across and the framed awning 4.241 m, against 4.5 m of
	## lattice. Two-cell remainders take the fishmonger's table (2.064 m) and

	## cladding this same compile lays, as `(standoff, shift)`: how far further
	## OUT than its own half-depth, and how far ALONG the face from its window's
	## own middle.
	##
	## TWO NUMBERS BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO WAYS A WALL IS IN THE WAY, and the second
	## is the one the first pass of this round missed. A piece fronting a clad
	## face is buried by the cladding IN FRONT of it, and standing further out
	## fixes that. A piece standing in a re-entrant corner of the town's edge --
	## where the column beside the one it fronts carries mass the ground band does
	## not -- is buried by the cladding BESIDE it, and no amount of standing
	## further out escapes a wall you are moving along. Measured on 12/compact:
	## the stand-off alone took 31 buried pieces to 1, and the last one is that
	## corner (`maze-frontage/-6/0/1/0`, a barrel 0.253 m inside a facade panel
	## belonging to the column diagonally across from it).
	##
	## THE SHIFT IS THE FREE-BOX IDIOM THIS FILE ALREADY OWNS. `maze_decor_free_
	## box` shrinks a garden cell by whatever is built on its sides and moves the
	## planter's centre with the shrinking, "instead of centring it on a plane
	## half of which is masonry". This is the same rule for the same reason, over
	## the ground `_frontage_window_is_free` has already cleared: the free
	## interval along the face, and the piece clamped into it. A window whose free
	## interval already holds the piece keeps it dead centre, so the shift is zero
	## everywhere the corner case is not.
	##
	## BOUNDED BY THE GATE'S OWN GROUND, which is what makes the shift free. The
	## gate clears `spread + (overhang + 0.5) x CELL_SIZE` either side of the
	## window's middle, and that span covers `half_width` by construction -- so
	## the interval is never narrower than the piece unless cladding takes a bite

	## leaves 3.0 - 0.591 = 2.409 m over a street two bands down against the
	## 2.284 m a body needs -- 125 mm. One band down leaves 0.909 m and is
	## refused. That case cannot arise on a sealed town (the BOARD alone already
	## leaves 1.38 m there, so the clearance row would be red before this ran),
	## and it is gated and counted anyway rather than argued away.
	##
	## TASK I4 ROUND 5, ITEM 3 -- AND A STREET IS NOT THE ONLY THING A BODY
	## STANDS ON. "it looks like there is not enough headroom for the character
	## between the two levels of platforms." The gate above asked ONE question --
	## is the cell below a walked cell of the public realm -- and a lawn is not
	## one, nor is a plank terrace: both are CAPS, whose surface is the top of the
	## cell BELOW them. So the same 0.909 m the rule refuses over a street could
	## be hung over a garden or over a terrace without a word.
	##
	## `capped` is every cell whose TOP a body stands on -- the garden cells and
	## the deck cells of the same shell -- so a cap two bands under the plate puts
	## its surface one band under it, which is the case the street rule already
	## refuses. It defaults to empty, which keeps the pre-round answer for a
	## caller that does not hold the shell.
	##
	## THE CLAUSE IS GATED AND HAS NEVER FIRED, and the round-5 report's claim
	## that it refused two corbels on 4/compact was that town's PRE-EXISTING
	## "not borne" pair, not this branch. The r4+r5 review measured it directly:
	## `capped_only_refusals = 0` on all five review towns, and the corpus's
	## `floor_bearers` row is byte-identical across that round. It is live the
	## moment the arithmetic changes -- exactly as the one-band street case above
	## has been since round 1 -- and until then it costs nothing and claims
	## nothing. Round 6 narrows `capped` further (a cap with a real module inside
	## body height of its surface is no longer dressed at all, so it is no longer
	## a stance), which makes the clause rarer rather than commoner.

	## two ends. Deterministic and disjoint -- no cell belongs to two spans.
	##
	## SITE SELECTION IS STRUCTURAL FIRST AND SEEDED SECOND, which is what the
	## direction asks for: the rules below are the scarce filter (the four
	## planner towns offer 0-4 sites each out of 136-278 walkable cells), and the
	## seed decides only which of two OVERLAPPING candidates wins. Adding an
	## acceptance roll on top would only turn a town with three bridges into a
	## town with two; the geometry is already the rate.
	##
	## A SITE IS SIX FACTS, and each of them is a way a bridge could be wrong:
	##
	## 1. BOTH ENDS ARE WALKED SURFACES AT ONE BAND -- a terrace crown, a roof
	##    deck, a gallery or a public floor. A bridge you cannot step onto is
	##    scenery; a bridge whose far end is a storey up is a stair, and the
	##    catalog ships no walkway stair piece that tiles this lattice.
	## 2. IT IS AN UPPER CROSSING. The near end stands above the town's lowest
	##    walked band, so a span can never be a plank laid across the street it
	##    is supposed to fly over.
	## 3. THE GAP IS AIR. Every cell between the ends is free of built solid,
	##    retained mass, public floor and walk surface, and so is the band
	##    directly beneath it (SKYWALK_UNDERCUT_BANDS) -- otherwise the "gap" is
	##    a notch in one terrace and the bridge is a plank on a bench.
	## 4. IT CROSSES A STREET. At least one gap column has a walked cell below
	##    it. This is the reference frame's own subject and it is deliberately
	##    strict: it costs the corpus two of eight candidate sites and it is what
	##    stops a bridge being hung over a private yard nobody looks up from.
	## 5. THE STREET KEEPS ITS HEADROOM. Every walked cell below any gap column
	##    is at least SKYWALK_MIN_HEADROOM_BANDS down -- see that constant for
	##    the arithmetic, and the sweep's clearance row for the live proof.
	## 6. THE WALK CARRIES ITS OWN CLEARANCE. SKYWALK_HEAD_BANDS above each gap
	##    cell are free of built mass and public surfaces, so a body can stand on
	##    the bridge. An open rail bridge still occupies walking headroom; it is
	##    not permission to stack another walkway through a player's capsule.

	## floor bay, two window walls and one compact blue roof. Only the two outer
	## ends carry portals, so adjacent bays form one passage rather than a row of
	## closed rooms.
	##
	## Over spans a caller ALREADY DERIVED, and there is no convenience wrapper
	## that derives them here (fix 1, minor 1: there was one, `maze_skywalks`,
	## and nothing ever called it). The payload derives the spans once and hands
	## the same array to this and to `maze_skywalk_cells`, so the bridges the
	## town renders and the cells the outcropping channel keeps clear can never
	## be two different answers -- which a second derivation is exactly how to
	## break.
	##
	## THE DECK is the same authored plank floor the public realm's own galleries
	## are laid with, and it is laid FLUSH: its top face lands exactly on
	## `band x CELL_SIZE`, which is the walk surface of the terrace crown at each
	## end (`maze_terrace_railings` states the same datum), so a body steps onto
	## the bridge without a lip. Both forms take the 1.5 m module, whose authored
	## pivot lies on its own +X seam and is corrected here exactly as
	## `_add_plank_tile` corrects it. The enclosed form stays narrow enough to
	## preserve the adjacent street lane instead of becoming a hovering block.
	##
	## THE RAILS are the pair that makes it read as a bridge rather than as a
	## shelf, and they are the modules the terrace edges already use: one 3.0 m
	## rail per side over a two-cell span, one 1.5 m rail per side over a
	## one-cell span, standing ON the deck and centred on the deck's own edge.
	##
	## THE BEARERS are the visible bearing, one under each end: the measured
	## 1.94 m corbel starts on the endpoint building's facade plane and reaches
	## ALONG the bridge into its deck. This is the construction direction of a
	## cantilever and keeps the authored timber inside the air column the span's
	## headroom proof owns. The older crosswise plate spilled into an unrelated
	## lateral street one band below; no local headroom rule could make that
	## correct. Two short-span corbels overlap as a continuous beam, which is an
	## intentional semantic seam between identical supports rather than a loose

	## over complete adjacent pairs so the visual recipe never has to widen or

	##
	## FOUR FACTS QUALIFY A PANEL, and each is a way a projection could be wrong:
	##
	## 1. IT IS A SIDE FACE WEARING A BUILDING STOREY -- a FACADE panel of the
	##    clad mass. A retaining course does not grow a bay window and neither
	##    does a garden cap.
	## 2. IT IS AN UPPER STOREY. The same face carries another panel one course
	##    below it, so there is a house under the projection rather than a
	##    pavement. This is the direction's own "on upper storeys".
	## 3. THE AIR IN FRONT IS FREE, over the panel's whole course AND OVER THE
	##    BAND ITS BEARERS HANG IN: no built solid, no retained mass, no public
	##    floor, nobody's walk surface, and no skywalk. A bay occupies exactly
	##    the one cell in front of its panel, so that is exactly the cell this
	##    asks about.
	## 4. THE STREET UNDER IT KEEPS ITS HEADROOM --
	##    FACADE_OUTCROP_MIN_HEADROOM_BANDS, whose arithmetic is written at the
	##    constant and whose live proof is the corpus sweep's clearance row.
	##
	## Each continuous horizontal course selects one depth before emission.
	## Alternating adjacent pairs made a garden's covering boards zigzag without
	## any change in the bank behind them. Separate courses can still use either
	## authored profile; all pairs in one run share their available profile domain.

	## there is, and a caller that forgets it should not silently get the full

	## `maze_stone_face_overhangs_walk or maze_stone_cap_juts_over_walk` -- one
	## flag, one meaning, and the branch below decides which axis it cuts. A
	## SIDE panel is cut back to its own band (it hangs into the street under
	## it); a CAP is cut back to its own run (it reaches into the street beside
	## it). Each predicate answers for its own kind of panel and false for the
	## other, so the two can never both be asking.
	##
	## TASK H2c FIX 1 SUB-ROUND. `trimmed` is the coursed twin of the rock's
	## tail clamp, and it exists for the same defect in the same words: the
	## module is STONE_MODULE_HEIGHT tall cladding a 1.5 m band and "buries its
	## lower half in the course beneath", and where that course is an open
	## street it buries itself in the street instead. A panel two courses over a
	## walked cell hangs to `(band + 1) x CELL - 3.0`, which is 0.8 m inside the
	## headroom of a body standing down there -- so the coursing reads on, and
	## the street is shut by a wall nobody can see the bottom of.
	##
	## Trimmed, the module covers its own band EXACTLY: half height, re-anchored
	## so its top still lands on the course boundary.
	##
	## NOTHING OPENS ABOVE IT, and the reason is the anchor rather than any
	## neighbour (fix 2, minor 2 -- the first telling of this said a panel one
	## band up covered our band twice, which coursing makes impossible: panels
	## sit STONE_COURSE_BANDS apart, so a column with a panel at y has none at
	## y + 1). The trim moves the module's BOTTOM edge only; its top stays
	## anchored at `(y + 1) x CELL_SIZE`, which is the course boundary the panel
	## above it, if any, hangs from. The seam is where it always was.
	##
	## BELOW IT, THE CLAIM IS TRUE AT g = 1 AND CONTINGENT AT g = 2 (fix 2,
	## important 1). `maze_stone_face_overhangs_walk` fires on a walked cell one
	## or two bands down, and the panel clads the course {y, y - 1}:
	##
	## * g = 1 -- band y - 1 IS the walked street, so it carries no exposed face
	##   and the course is one band. The only overlap the trim gives up is with
	##   open air. Unconditionally sound.
	## * g = 2 -- band y - 1 could be stone whose face is exposed and paired
	##   into this course, and the trim would leave the whole of it bare. It
	##   cannot be, while `blocked = 0`: stone directly over the walked cell at
	##   band y - 2 wears a floor-facing masonry cap flush with that cell's
	##   ceiling, and the cell is 1.5 m against a 2.334 m body, so the capsule
	##   is stopped at every offset and the cell counts `blocked`. THE CASE THAT
	##   FIRED IS THIS ONE -- both 6/standard blockers are band-2 panels over a

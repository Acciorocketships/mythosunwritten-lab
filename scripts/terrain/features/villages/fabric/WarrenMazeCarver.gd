## TASK E2 -- MOMENTUM (controller ruling 1). A preference inside the existing
## candidate score, not a new search: one pass, no lookahead, deterministic.
##
## Before E2 the spine's two orientation terms were `score += next_straight *
## 55` (continuing straight COST 55 per cell already run) and `score -= 45`
## (turning was REWARDED). That is an explicitly ANTI-momentum rule, and it is
## what made the street wander over the terraced massif E1 built: measured
## 3.89 / 5.00 / 4.23 / 4.14 direction changes per 10 spine cells on the four
## profile seeds. Momentum inverts both: continuing the current heading, and
## continuing the current VERTICAL tendency, are each worth a bonus, and
## reversing the vertical tendency costs.
##
## The weights sit deliberately between the two tiers the score already had.
## They are larger than the per-stride frontage terms (105 a side, 160 a
## two-sided cell) so a street that is going somewhere is not deflected by one
## extra addressed wall, and smaller than the radius (240 a cell) and
## span-deficit (520 a band) terms that decide WHERE the street is going -- so
## momentum steers the route, it never overrules the destination. Nothing here
## can make an illegal stride legal: the terrace, the straight-run cap, and
## `WarrenPassageLatticeRules.stride_cells` still decide what may be carved,
## which is what "unless the terrace forces a turn" means in code.

## TASK E2 -- POST-SUMMIT DESCENT (controller ruling 1). One terrace, in the
## massif's own units (`WarrenMassifBuilder.TERRACE_BANDS` is the same
## constant), is what the descent aims to spend before it stops caring about
## height and only cares about reaching the rim.
const DESCENT_TARGET_BANDS := WarrenBuildingParcel.STOREY_BANDS

## The descent's cell budget, as a share of the profile's authored spine.
##
## It is a budget of its own rather than a slice of `route_cell_range`, and
## that is a measurement, not a preference: on all four profile seeds the
## CLIMB alone already ends at exactly `route_cell_range.y` (18/22/26/29 of
## 18/22/26/30). A compact town spends six cells of at-grade market approach
## and then needs five risers to clear `route_span_range.x`, which is the
## whole authored range. The profile's number describes a climb because until
## E2 the spine was only ever a climb; the descent is new public street and
## says so here instead of quietly shortening the ascent and risking the towns
## that only just satisfy their span.
##
## `/ 3` clamped to 4..10 gives 6 / 7 / 8 / 10 cells -- two to five descending
## strides, so a town can always spend DESCENT_TARGET_BANDS (two STAIR_DOWNs,
## four cells) and still have somewhere to put the run that carries it out to
## the rim.

	## TASK D1. The square's two extra cells are admitted by
	## `slot_is_borable` alone, which refuses a cell BELOW its own terrain --
	## the bank stays uncut, as the immutable-terrain rule requires -- and
	## admits one standing ON the mass a downhill step left under it. The
	## stricter `is_at_grade` that used to guard them as well says
	## `cell.y == base_at`, which on flat ground is implied by borability (the
	## approach is at grade and the side cells share its band) and on a slope
	## silently became "the square's far side must be at the SAME terrain
	## height as its approach". A 2 x 2 level square never is on a hillside,
	## so the universal market simply refused: 7 of 24 corpus towns on the
	## 5-band ramp fixture, and it was the single largest sloped rejection.

	## `WarrenMazeSourcePlan.seal` re-checks it -- so the market remains the
	## ground-level room off the town's own street, now with a retained
	## terrace under its low side instead of nothing at all.
	##
	## TASK D1, second half. The approach cells this square is built from must
	## be WALK NODES, not merely route cells. `WarrenExcavationVolumeAdapter`
	## makes a walk cell out of a transition's endpoint only -- a STAIR's or a
	## RAMP's intermediate stride cell is bored public floor but never a graph
	## node (its own docstring says why: the transition already owns that
	## column's tread surface) -- and both the square's typed cells
	## (`mark_market_square_cell`) and its closing loop edge are refused
	## against a non-node. On flat ground the invariant held silently: an
	## at-grade approach can only be made of LEVEL, run-one moves, so every
	## approach cell WAS a node. On real ground the approach follows the
	## terrain up, so it contains stride intermediates, and the square landed

	## in the endpoint room envelopes made construction impossible on a compact
	## town: it confused the material being replaced with the building being
	## planned. This proof instead states the finished load path by construction.
	##
	## FIX 1, MINOR 5 -- the roof band is `slot_bands` where that is deeper
	## than HEADROOM_BANDS. A span cell is always a LEVEL stride, whose bore is
	## exactly HEADROOM_BANDS, so on this corpus the two are the same number
	## and the `maxi` is inert -- but `slot_bands` is what
	## `_bridge_room_storey` and `WarrenPlotPlanner._span_bridges` both read,

	## for the first stride kind that carves deeper. Stated by construction
	## rather than left as an empirical accident.

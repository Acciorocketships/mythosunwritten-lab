	# not PUBLISHED anywhere — "give those towns a courtyard, or publish the
	# shortfalls, and only then may these three join the advisory set" — under a
	# Phase E courtyard story that was never tasked. Task F3 measured the bill:
	# 0 of 12 seeds sealed at large and 0 of 12 at grand, 14 of the 24 refused by
	# the courtyard family alone, which is ~15 % of production city seeds
	# producing no town at all. Task F4 met the stated condition instead of
	# waiting: `composed_courtyard_sides`, `courtyard_bridge_houses` and
	# `elevated_courtyards` are now real `advisory_shortfalls` keys, so the three
	# terms join the advisory set on their own original terms. Re-measured after
	# the flip: large seals 3 of 12 and grand 1 of 12, and every sealed one of
	# them arrives here courtless.
	#
	# What stays hard here is the CEILING — a compact town that somehow carried a
	# court would still be a town promoted past its own size contract — and both
	# column floors on a town that actually HAS a court, where they are
	# measurements of a real thing rather than of an absence.

	# anything, and this states them in prose rather than passing them to a

	# must be present" -- the same constant-argument shape task F1 deleted

# scripts/terrain/field/CliffDressing.gd
# Hangs real KayKit cliff pieces (rock wall slabs + beveled grass lip + inner/outer
# corner pieces) on the field mesh's cliff edges. The field mesh stays the walkable base
# + collision; these are visual only, batched into one MultiMesh per piece type per chunk.
#
# `compute()` returns the placement DATA (plain Transform3D arrays) so it is unit-testable
# in headless mode, where MultiMesh.get_instance_transform does not read back. `build()`
# turns that data into MultiMeshInstance3D nodes. Placement reference:
# terrain/scenes/cliff/CliffSide.tscn and CliffCorner.tscn.

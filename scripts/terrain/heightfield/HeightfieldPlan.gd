class_name HeightfieldPlan
extends RefCounted

## Deterministic, churn-free numerical terrain plan. A continuous height field
## H(cell) is quantized into integer cliff storeys and trickle-down clamped so
## adjacent cells never differ by more than one storey. The result is a pure
## function of (world_seed, cell), so a tile's planned height is final before it
## is ever instantiated — the anti-churn guarantee.
##
## Phases 1-2: storey (cliff) + level (terrace) tiers. See
## docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-17-heightfield-terrain-design.md.

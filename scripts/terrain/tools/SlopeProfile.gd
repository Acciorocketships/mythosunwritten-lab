# --- stacked (mating) corner profiles --------------------------------------
# A 2-storey corner is ONE S: flat at both far ends, steepest at the storey seam.
# Upper tile = top half of the S (convex), lower tile = bottom half (concave).
# The S's steep inflection sits AT the seam, so the upper tile's bottom tangent
# and the lower tile's top tangent match -> the stacked corner is C1.
#
# `_top_s` / `_bot_s` are the two halves of a smootherstep S, split at its t=0.5
# inflection: _top_s(d) runs the flat-shoulder->inflection half (0 flat at d=0,
# steepest at d=1), _bot_s(e) runs the inflection->flat-shoulder half (steepest
# at e=0, flat at e=1). Both have slope 1.875 per unit input at the seam, so when
# fed matching coordinates the world tangents agree (test_seam_tangents_mate).
#
# The catch: the normal `_ramp` (smootherstep) is FLAT at the far corner, which
# would zero the world derivative there. So the corner steepening is driven by a
# LINEAR seam-band coordinate (`UP_BAND`/`IN_BAND` wide) that has constant non-zero slope
# at the seam corner. The steep field is gated to the diagonal (k = a*b for outer,
# vanishing toward the +,+ seam for inner) so the edge-seams keep the plain `edge`
# / flat profile beside the corner.

# Band widths (world units) over which the steep S-half ramps at the storey seam,
# and how much of the inner onset is the steep seam band vs the gentle tail. Tuned
# so the outer-bottom and inner-top seam tangents agree (test_seam_tangents_mate)
# while the plateau end stays soft (test_outer_stacked_soft_at_plateau).

# Repurposed (2026-06-21): the 2-STOREY diagonal-ramp corner. Where a convex
# corner column sits two storeys above a diagonal pit (the cardinal clamp forces
# the two adjoining cardinals to exactly one storey between, and a diagonal drop
# can never exceed two), a single 1-storey corner tile cannot reach the pit floor
# — it bottoms out a storey up, leaving a sheer drop into the pit. This profile
# descends BOTH storeys across the corner's open diagonal as the SUM of the two
# per-axis edge ramps:
#   * along each cardinal edge-seam one ramp is 0 (b=_ramp(+HALF)=0 at the +x
#     seam, a=0 at the +z seam), so it reduces to exactly the plain `edge`
#     profile -> it mates continuously with the 1-storey sloping neighbour there;
#   * at the open-diagonal vertex (a=b=1) it reaches 2*BOTTOM = the pit floor.

# tangent (C1). Both `seam` and `base` vanish at the x=+HALF (or z=+HALF) edge-seam,
# so q->0 and _bot_s(0)=0 keeps the edge-seams flat (test_inner_stacked_edge_seam_is_flat).

> before/after game renders, nearby views, pixel differences and relevant
> physical/field regressions. Evidence is indexed at
> `/Users/ryko/Documents/Codex/2026-09-08/i-did-a-manual-judging-pass/outputs/verification-index.md`.
> The source overlays round coordinates to 0.1 m: replay cameras match each

> Native facade end ownership now distinguishes a measured retaining miter
> from a room miter. The offline baker handles unindexed source triangles,
> closes the referenced cut faces and removes only explicitly shared jetty
> ends. Floor subtraction assigns coincident boundaries to one owner using a
> 1 micrometre classification tolerance without moving source vertices. A cap
> wholly owned by a room floor emits no remainder; test censuses must verify
> the real floor triangles before crediting that logical boundary. Window 010
> explicitly opts into fitting its complete panel into a deep doorway return;
> bake version 31 preserves its height, relief and UVs before ordinary joints.
>
> Shallow outcrops use their actual supported projection. Flower anchors sit
> above the soil inside their reserved planter. Stair guards subtract the
> completed wall envelope, including hanging courses; exposed portions retain
> collision. Ends receive taller posts and each face has nondegenerate UVs.
> Terminal rising flights reserve a supported 2-by-2-cell overlook, including
> its headroom, before later construction. Raised exterior entrances reserve
> the complete flight and clear approach before selecting their direction.
>
> The long bridge's authored collision follows its arch and preserves the
> bank handoff under longitudinal scaling. Swimming aborts an active jump
> one-shot so the underlying animation continues. Roadside lamps sample the
> final graded ground at their declared contact. Complete-house path contacts
> distinguish the real porch toe from the entrance and support rectangle.
> House 001 keeps its native door leaf posed open around its authored hinge;
> its baked collision leaves the doorway traversable.
>
> Streaming rebases urgency from physical proximity and bounded velocity
> lookahead. Terrain requests publish feature-halo dependencies immediately;
> those dependencies inherit their waiting terrain's urgency and can finish
> separately from distant terrain work. Fine-grid vertex reuse and conservative
> local path samplers preserve geometry and collision. Both reported running
> approaches cross with zero frozen frames; the unrelated 60-second cold-start
> test still fails in the preserved baseline.
>
> Sub-lattice water rescue uses untapered hydraulic levels and a fixed one-ring
> witness from originally wet coarse nodes. Complete source-fill extents obtain
> every intersecting river/pond through `WaterPlan.bodies_in_rect`; a larger
> solve must not use only the initiating chunk's river inventory. This prevents
> a missing distant river constraint from sending high water onto lower land.
> Ground-grade collars compose smooth compact influences from maximal
> rectangles of the exact claimed-cell union. They preserve the ordinary 12 m
> straight-pad profile and fixed pad heights while removing nearest-edge cusps.
>
> Non-collidable bushes explicitly request `visual_ground_support`; the compiler
> prepares their native base stencil on the main thread and the ordinary tree
> support checks reject cliff/slope overhangs. All six bush assets use the existing
> biome-canopy hue replacement. Bush palette colors blend absolute tree and
> substrate colors, never the ground texture's relative color multipliers.

> September 8 independent porch review: an authored ground entrance may
> declare the measured toe of its native porch separately from its placement
> datum and conservative foundation rectangle. The SFV 006 approach now ends
> at that real tread. Physical tests cover both themes in four orientations;
> seven related tests pass with 6,231 assertions. Matched photo 9, nearby
> pixel differences and six strict live porch traversals verify the cleanup.

> September 8 river-bank review: gentle reaches
> widen the terrain carve through the ordinary ground kernel; steep descents
> and their abutments retain the established narrow profile. A bounded cache
> holds deterministic bank strengths. Banks constrain water without becoming
> water seeds; terminal lakes retain their connected shore domain. Fine water
> topology uses the same dry-bank constraints and 64-bit queue labels. Adjacent
> water trigger boxes overlap by 1 mm per side, while the frozen sampler still
> owns exact wetness. Matched photo 10 and nearby pixel differences pass;
> four shoreline traversals stay grounded, and six neighboring-town entrance
> traversals pass. The 95 related tests pass with 18,896 assertions.

> September 8 garden-border review: a connected facade bank chooses one
> shared outcrop profile from its reserved clearance. Shallow caps fit the
> actual projection instead of borrowing the full gallery depth. Photo 1,
> nearby angles and pixel differences pass; all 140 west-town walk cells and
> 205 crossings retain identical clearance. Photos 11/12 remain clean.

> September 8 gate-paint review: the ground handoff shares the exterior road's
> 4 m painted width. The two-cell structural aperture retains its complete
> stair, walk and headroom reservation. Photo 5 and nearby pixel comparisons
> verify removal of the intermediate wide tabs; rotated and connected-gate
> regressions pass.

> September 8 door-path review: complete prefab houses address the measured
> doorway center. Their closed-leaf attachment keeps its authored hinge origin;
> those are distinct coordinates. Photo 6, nearby views and pixel differences
> verify the centered approaches; all seven houses in four orientations retain
> physical jamb clearance.

> September 8 destination review: a terminal rising stair reserves an available
> neighboring platform and its open sky before bridge compounds and house plots.
> The unchanged climb meets a larger guarded overlook where adjacent room floors
> cannot supply a real doorway. Source reservations survive final construction;
> photo 8 and nearby renders, 12 walking traversals and 128 clear walk cells /
> 185 clear crossings verify the photographed town.

> September 8 stair motion: step-up samples the actual horizontal destination.
> A short ray at an ambiguous capsule contact verifies the tread's real top;
> it never supplies a future tread height. The normal step-limited floor snap
> retains an 80 ms witness across rounded tread noses. Character presentation
> and camera share one critically damped height response; animation uses the
> same grounded witness, while jumps and real ledges remain airborne. All five
> photographed flights pass streamed ascent/descent; normal and slow side-lane
> runs pass, alongside jump, ceiling, obstacle and animation regressions.

> September 8 exterior finishing: closed doorway return cuts survive shared
> corner ownership. Native timber closes miter cuts; authored stone relief
> finishes deep rock-door ends inside the original envelope. Retaining banks
> use stone-only stock fitted to their declared joining bounds; isolated free
> shoulders continue masonry. Ledge caps use horizontal boards with exact
> private-floor ownership and main-thread source preparation. Matched photos
> 3/4/9 and nearby pixel comparisons pass; photos 7/11 retain their earlier
> repairs. Physical clearance is unchanged across 124 cells and 179 crossings.

> September 8 inline facade joins: adjacent room runs with different authored
> depths declare one recessed timber seam member inside the existing room
> envelope. The native mesh closes the full course in all four orientations.
> Photo 7 and nearby pixel comparisons pass; physical clearance is identical
> across 124 walk cells and 179 crossings. Perpendicular ends remain under review.

> September 8 doorway caps: full-height door panels publish the same exact
> floor-cap ownership as other facades. A 5 mm base-datum allowance includes
> imported door feet; top-face clipping retains its 1 mm tolerance. Photo 11
> and the actual shared-triangle regression verify the balcony overlap.

> September 8 floor placement: single-cell authored boards receive the logical
> cell center; their asset pivot is corrected exactly once. Larger board unions
> retain their union centers. Courtyard paving uses the same convention, matching
> the existing collision boundary. Photo 12 and nearby matched pixel comparisons
> verify the overlapping floor strips; exterior trim remains under review.

> September 8 morning review (in progress): raised exterior portals now declare
> an architectural flight and a full lower landing before outskirts frontage
> allocation. The same gate geometry supplies its street contact and occupancy;
> the public surface compiler opens the declared landing seam. A raised platform
> does not force its height into adjacent fine-grid ground controls. Gate flights
> reuse the ordinary stair builder and assign shared posts once. The new frozen
> west-town regression fails before and passes after in four orientations.
> Matched photos 2/13 and nearby views remove the ground spikes; both approaches
> pass six streamed ascent/descent checks each, and 64 perimeter cases pass.
> Stair motion and other surface joins remain separate open issues. Do not treat
> the rest of the September 8 morning issue list as fixed.

> September 8 manual slope review: extending streets preserves the existing
> continuous TerrainGradePatch field instead of sampling a second conical ramp
> into 3 m plateau controls. Foundation additions retain fixed pad heights and
> inherited street fields; bounds compose those same fields. The ordinary
> terrain kernel and 12 m collar remain the only slope authority. A bounded
> 64-bit target/weight cache preserves exact cold samples and natural inputs.
> The September 7 sixth-photo views, normal-profile regressions and streamed
> ascent/descent pass; all five public stair flights remain walkable.

> September 8 manual garden-wall review: roof solid cells reserve clearance,
> but do not occlude neighboring vertical retaining skins. Room mass still
> closes those seams. Retaining course style follows the complete bank even
> when a neighboring room hides its lower portion. Payload and panel clearance
> share the final shell. The September 7 fourth photo, nearby views, actual
> wall meshes and unchanged public clearance verify the reported garden wall.

> September 7 manual stair review: transition tread count respects the planned
> world-space step limit after scale and the shared ground-datum guard. A 3 m
> flight now has eight 37.5 cm risers; the first ground approach totals 45.5 cm.
> Landings, flight footprint and player step limits are unchanged. The frozen
> ground-handoff walking regression fails before and passes after; matched
> streamed walking verifies all five public flights without jumping, alongside
> all original photo angles in `04-stairs-after` and their pixel differences.

> September 7 manual street review: the exterior circuit owns the town's
> ground street domain. Independent country-road paint yields inside it;
> incoming lattice arms publish boundary handoffs before frontage allocation.
> Town streets retain priority and outside country roads remain unchanged.
> The frozen photographed frontage has one 4 m street, unchanged house access
> points, and three connected world-road handoffs. Four-orientation tests and
> matched `03-path-candidate` views/pixel differences pass.

> September 7 manual floor review: private room floors participate in retained
> ground-cap ownership. Partial caps and upright wall tops use the existing
> exact triangle ownership, retaining uncovered source coordinates, UVs and
> collision. The offline wall-interface manifest declares a 1 mm imported-face
> tolerance; construction matches the declared course plane. Resource-free
> interface arrays are prepared on the main thread. The photographed floor
> overlap regression and matched `02-floor-candidate` views pass; cell/crossing
> clearance remains identical. Other manual issues remain under review.

> September 7 manual wall review: neighboring generated room shells own their
> shared corner. Diagonal contacts retain square ends into one timber joint;
> inside corners use a native wall return between the rear reveals, with both
> slab thicknesses projected along the meeting angle. Masonry corners include
> inhabited room volume. A low retained shoulder can carry a one-band return
> between taller masonry and a diagonal house; it requires its existing bearing
> and cannot consume an owned walking surface. `test_september7_wall_enclosure.gd`
> covers the photographed source, four orientations and absent-bearing cases.
> The matched `docs/qa/2026-09-07-manual/01-gaps-after` views and pixel differences
> verify the reported gaps. The full photographed town retains identical
> clearance across 124 walk cells and 179 crossings. Photo 2's reconstructed
> camera is behind the closed return; separately matched side views and the
> production collision-resolved camera record that distinction. Other issues
> from this manual pass remain under review.

> September 7 entrance construction: each exterior portal keeps its own transverse
> coordinate until it meets the shared perimeter. Secondary entrances must not snap
> to the primary entrance's lattice phase, which creates diagonal paint notches.
> Completed physical clearance is inspected by `perimeter_gate_corpus.gd` (four
> seeds, four scales, four orientations; 64 completed cases). The matched `perimeter-straight-gates-after` views
> confirm the reported junction and entrance edges. Roof gardens, as well as pitched
> roofs, use the remaining space after fixed ground-frame columns are reserved.
>
> September 7 column construction: provisional upper bands continue their declared
> bearing column and end at its available height. Lateral packing retries are removed;
> the room grammar owns explicit supported changes of floorplate. The (16,-201) roof
> regression and the production corpus verify this independently.

# Project Instructions (AGENTS.md)

> September 7 support construction: cantilever courses select one authored
> profile from previously reserved feature envelopes. They share one timber
> frame and no longer enumerate 2^N course combinations or backtrack across
> the town. The frozen exhaustive solver is test-only; all 16 mixed-course
> cases match it, and the 48-town physical clearance corpus remains clear.
> Compact bracket clearance is independently audited by tests.
>
> Graded streets own their full width before house pads. Graded cliff backing
> and authored rock vertices use the same final height field; fully collapsed
> rock triangles are omitted. Main-thread preparation extracts resource-free
> source arrays for worker deformation. Immutable regions memoize repeated
> grade-influence queries for authored piece bounds.
>
> September 7 perimeter follow-up: the owner requests one constant-width
> exterior circuit and a shared approach junction. `VillageOutskirtsConstruction`
> derives four straight frontage sides from the finished town envelope and
> places houses directly along them. Reserve the incoming approach before
> consuming frontage intervals. `FeatureGroundField.construction_clearance_bounds`
> includes the canonical road lattice as well as explicit shapes. Every street
> has the same 4 m painted/headroom width; conservative final-ground extrema
> bound its headroom. Old cliff aprons disappear wherever grading closes the
> discontinuity. The matched `perimeter-clean-after` overhead and ground views
> pass visual review for the reported spurs, width and staggered junctions;
> broader validation remains in progress.

> September 7 water/travel follow-up: a terminal `PondStamp` caps its natural
> bank datum at the incoming river's hydraulic surface; its carved bed follows
> that same datum. Never reconcile a new lake by raising kilometres of an
> already-descended river. `WaterField` solves complete in-context source
> extents before projecting the normal 42m chunk halo; a bounded CPU cache
> shares those solves. Current-geography seam regressions are separate from
> historical screenshot fixtures. Fully flooded chunks emit water even when
> no shoreline crosses the chunk. The source solve remains finite; the border
> survey reports wet domain edges as well as shared-chunk disagreement.
> Streaming requests retain ownership through
> the worker-to-main hand-off, skip unchanged queue mutations, and rebase
> priorities as the player travels. Urgent feature dependencies can publish
> before their distant terrain component. `PROFILE_STREAMING` enables bounded
> queue/phase diagnostics; `tests/harness/travel_profile.tscn` provides real
> walking, separately labelled obstacle-bypassing traversal, and fixed-camera
> graphics ablations. The 49-chunk profiler now includes production grading.
> These measurements identify expensive graded/path subdivision and collision
> commits; they do not establish that construction or rendering is fully optimized.

> September 7 room-band follow-up: paired rooms are constructed by ascending
> absolute floor band from current lower plates. Existing upper contacts bound
> their room domain. When an upper plate moves, its newly exposed lower roof
> immediately reserves its air before another lineage can use it. Frozen source
> regression fixtures include bridge-span ownership and frontage reservations,
> as those are construction facts even where old field names say `audit`.
> Ground-frame posts explicitly publish their single `post` flashing placement;
> only the measured narrow member and a named supporting-room roof can join.


> September 7 shallow-roof follow-up: one-sided roof skins publish an explicit
> `FabricRecipe.roof_high_edge` and use their occluder cells as the construction
> footprint. Their measured high edge meets the wall, transverse centre matches
> the cell run, and underside meets its bearing datum. Complete crowns retain
> their symmetric solid-volume contract. Two-cell runs centre at 0.75 m, not
> 1.5 m; all lengths/materials and deliberately shifted negative fixtures are
> covered by `test_shallow_roof_contract.gd`.


> September 7 frontage follow-up: finite house intervals are consumed from
> one end, preserving contiguous space for the next house without trial
> placement or repacking. Door paths meet their house's support boundary;
> test positive overlap separately from inclusive boundary contact.
> Historical building regressions keep frozen CPU source facts in
> `tests/fixtures/*source.txt` and run those through the current compiler;
> production does not read those fixtures.


> September 7 atmosphere rebuild: seven art-directed biomes retain the five
> historical content IDs and add `amber_heath` and `jade_wetlands`; display names
> are Sunwash Meadows, Lanternwood, Opal Highlands, Cherryveil, Moonfen, Amber
> Heath and Jade Estuary. `Helper.biome_weights5` is a compatibility name for
> seven normalized weights. Mood never changes the global sky, sun, fog or
> ambient light at the player's position. `BiomeAtmosphereField` samples the
> actual ground and continuous biome blend into CPU arrays; `BiomeChunkFx`
> commits world-space mist, grounded particles, exact-water fall spray and
> moving spirit lights on the main thread. Adjacent mist chunks share boundary
> samples. `BiomeGroundMap` projects the same field onto a canonical 48m grid
> in a bounded 3072m render window; 768m scrolls preserve overlapping samples
> exactly. Terrain, lips and grass share `ground_style.gdshaderinc` and the
> palette's real texture; paths and rock retain their distinct atlas texels.
> Canonical substrate colours live in `BiomeRegistry.SUBSTRATES`, with moss,
> chalk, silt, petal litter and amber earth detail resolved in world space.
> Tree materials use a manifest-declared `biome_canopy` hue replacement that
> preserves bark, including at bake time. Ground-cover grass remains beneath
> woodland canopy; the separate ecology/feature fields still own empty paths.
> `LandformField` contributes deterministic 768m geological provinces to BOTH
> natural ground and river descent (scarps, amphitheatres, terraces, mesas,
> ridges/passes, hollows and clefts). Production amplitude is 32m. Large lake
> stamps may preserve natural islands or peninsulas through their shared carve;
> no water-only decoration or second terrain authority is added. This changes
> seed geography. Construction must retain the owner's single-town policy.
> F6 cycles the biome review locations; F4 retains the existing review list.

> September 6 construction policy (owner instruction): a settlement generates
> one deterministic town and one world placement. Do not use audits to erase
> towns, retry terrain placements, or rebuild an optional alternate town.
> Construction defects belong in regression/corpus tests and must be corrected
> in the generator's space reservations and ownership rules. The production
> adapter now aligns its single primary gate and publishes the sealed grade
> patch; it no longer re-solves a flat preview against trial terrain quarters.
> Road connectivity does not control whether a settlement exists. The compiler
> now exposes `generate()` separately from the explicitly checked `solve()` and
> `validation_errors()` used by tests. `WarrenVolumetricSolver.generate()` is
> the production entry; its diagnostic `solve()` additionally collects the
> full-town module, foundation, masonry, terrace, and material audits. Payload
> assembly no longer revalidates a complete town or each generated payload.
> Unassigned-mass, route-overhead-supply and plot-mass scans run only when
> diagnostics are requested. Their pre-discard inspection does not supply
> construction facts. A parity regression requires identical construction with diagnostics enabled
> and disabled. The remaining lower-level construction
> searches and mixed seal/audit methods are still being migrated; this work is
> not yet accepted as a complete removal of runtime checks or retries.

> September 7 construction follow-up: production outskirts now use
> `VillageOutskirtsConstruction` and `VillageFrontageDomain`. Measured house
> envelopes subtract occupied space from continuous frontage intervals before
> a lot is selected; each selected lot emits one house and a flat grade pad.
> Different pad datums reserve disjoint footprints. The substantial-house
> cohort precedes smaller infill, and every final lane samples the completed
> grade. Inset porches own the walk from the outer base to the door; terrain
> paint stops at that base. Shared T/X junctions derive both inner curves from
> all declared street arms. Landings shorter than a path half-width stay square
> so capsule ends cannot overrun a doorway. The old outskirts trial solver is
> retained for legacy tests but is no longer called by `VillagePlan`.
> Deep door panels now keep whole ends, while perpendicular returns terminate
> at the measured doorway back plane. `export_door_return_manifest.gd` discovers
> the finite square/miter/back-plane alternatives offline; ordinary asset bake
> produces their visuals and collision. Suppressing an end owner withdraws its
> return cut. These choices retain the original conservative envelope. Matched
> doorway/facade review is still in progress; do not report it accepted yet.
> Terrain screenshot regressions additionally pin the original reported field
> in `tests/fixtures/september6_reported_terrain.json`, because the atmosphere
> rebuild intentionally changes seed geography. Exact historical screenshots
> use the original-world review copy; current-world tests remain separate.


> September 7 roof/support follow-up: actual unsuppressed placement bounds
> resolve connected-component clearance; broad boxes alone cannot create a
> false collision across empty space. Joined crowns choose the existing tight
> transverse profile when their eave belt contains allocated construction.
> Fixed ground-frame columns reserve their space before roof choice. Frames
> are built from low bearings upward and publish bearing through connected
> private mass; thin posts never pretend to fill a complete structural cell.
> Posts stop at private ceilings. A post may cross only its named bearing
> room's roof skin through the existing measured shallow seam contract.
> Canopies and roof trims explicitly name their flashing placements; furniture
> in the same recipe does not inherit that joint. Native compound L-shaped
> roof partitions retain complete return stamps. Interstitial infill consumes
> only cells outside mandatory roof space. `construction_diagnostics()` inspects
> existing construction without changing its audit, signature, or placements.
> The final court retry/rejection loop and court-selection room preflight are
> removed. Bridge endpoint crowns retain their explicit party-seam role ahead
> of neighborhood silhouette choices; even-cell roofs retain the phase-aligned
> floorplate center in both source reservations and final placement. Prospective
> party contacts derive from canonical room cells, independent of emitted faces.
> The 46-site regional corpus passed after those changes. Subsequent bearing
> work is under regression review: occupied contacts above a room constrain
> its floorplate domain. Exposed tops and undersides reserve their vertical
> interfaces before neighboring room variants are selected. The eight-sweep
> support repair/building-deletion routine is removed; production also no longer
> invokes repeated silhouette relief, crown truncation, or global roof repair.
> The six unused silhouette/crown repair helpers now live exclusively in
> `tests/fixtures/legacy_room_repair.gd`; their five regression tests remain.
> Source reservations and final roof construction share one canonical roof
> domain. Ordinary terminal rooms start with their complete house crown;
> bridge endpoints retain only their explicit party-seam profile. The duplicate
> second full-roof fallback pass is removed. The current 48-town scale corpus
> builds every town with 10,672 clear walk cells and 15,216 clear route gates.
> Roof asset selection and earlier construction searches still contain retries; do not report the
> owner's no-retry requirement complete yet.

> The maze carver now freezes its completed excavation and source directly.
> `WarrenExcavation.validate_construction()` retains the independent route,
> headroom, portal, loop and bridge checks for tests; it cannot withdraw a
> published walk. Source diagnostics are optional and preserve the same
> deterministic signature. Earlier alley/loop preview checks remain to migrate.
> Maze-to-volume projection similarly derives its exact walk surface and mass
> subtraction without a final validation gate. `WarrenVolumePlan` retains a
> separate diagnostic validator; optional diagnostics cannot alter the bore,
> mass or deterministic signature. Legacy checked volume callers still exist.

> Court corner closure derives its available cells from both structural solids
> and inhabited room volume. A supported gap beside a court is not public
> floor when a room owns either of its two headroom bands. The seed 2 grand
> town regression covers the former accidental paving beneath a room chimney.

> Wall-course surface ownership is under visual review. Full-height generated
> room facades select finite `.course_open` assets only when an actual upper
> floor overlaps their cap. The floor owns its exact rectangle; pure
> `FabricSurfaceOwnership` partitions the original baked cap triangles and
> retains every uncovered portion, including millimetre-wide ends, with its

> renders pass and nearby roof shoulders remain closed.

> Alley and loop construction now publishes each chosen connection once.
> `WarrenExcavation.frontage_reservations` preserves housing beside existing
> streets before later excavation; the size profile supplies the lane budget.
> The former completed-lane frontage audit, whole-volume preview, rollback,
> and next-candidate retry are removed. Source tests and the sloped frontage
> regression pass; full composition review is still required. Other source,
> roof, and room selection searches have not yet all been migrated.


> September 5 evening facade follow-up: generated-room miter choices carry

## What this project is

**MythosUnwritten** (Godot project name "Story"; repo `Acciorocketships/mythosunwritten`).
An open-ended, turn-based fantasy RPG conceived as an LLM-driven **world simulator** —
every non-player character and the world itself are meant to be agent-driven, with
narrative emerging rather than scripted. See **`docs/mythosunwritten-master-design.md`**
for the full vision; that document is the design north star.

- **Engine/language**: Godot 4.5, typed GDScript.
- **What exists today**: an infinite procedural terrain world plus a controllable,
  physics-driven character (walk, jump, step-up, swim) with an orbit camera. The RPG /
  combat / agent layers in the master design are not built yet.

## Quick commands

- **Run the game (windowed)**: `godot --path /Users/ryko/story`
  The terrain streams forever around the player, so a run does **not** self-exit — stop
  it with Ctrl-C / closing the window. For automated verification prefer the tests and
  the harness scenes below over a bare headless run.
- **Run all tests (GUT)**: `godot-test` (a shell alias for
  `godot -d --path /Users/ryko/story -s res://addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gconfig=res://tests/gutconfig.json`).
  Tests live in `tests/`, are named `test_*.gd`, and `extends GutTest`.
- **After moving/renaming a `class_name` script**: run
  `godot --headless --path /Users/ryko/story --import` once so Godot rebuilds the global
  script class cache; otherwise headless runs fail with "Could not find type X".
- **Profile terrain generation**: `godot --headless --path /Users/ryko/story -s res://tests/harness/profile_terrain.gd`
  prints per-phase build timings (49-chunk startup sweep + phase attribution). Paste the summary
  into perf-related commit messages.

## The core invariant: field-driven, deterministic, churn-free

Terrain is a **pure function of `(world_seed, cell)`**. A cell's final height is decided
before any geometry is instantiated, so tiles never retile, morph, or pop as neighbours
stream in. This is the whole point of the current architecture — it replaced an older
socket / module-catalog engine that grew terrain reactively and needed reveal margins and
churn suppression to hide the settling. **That socket engine is gone.** If you find docs
referring to `TerrainGenerator`, `TerrainModule*`, sockets, `WaterRule`, `PositionIndex`,
or generation "rules", they describe the retired system (see "Historical docs" below).

Keep the worker pipeline pure: plan, field, mesher/dressing `compute*` methods return
plain CPU-side data and are headless-unit-testable. Render/physics resources and nodes are
created only by the explicit main-thread `commit*` adapters; only `FieldTerrainStreamer`
attaches those nodes to the active scene tree. Never create `MeshInstance3D`, `MultiMesh`,
`ArrayMesh`, collision shapes, or other server-backed resources in the streamer worker.

## Terrain pipeline (`scripts/terrain/`)

Data flows: **HeightfieldPlan → HeightfieldRegion → TerrainSurfaceField → TerrainChunkMesher**,
with sibling **WaterSkin** and **DressingField** payloads, driven per-chunk by
**FieldTerrainStreamer**.

- **`heightfield/HeightfieldPlan.gd`** — the deterministic plan. A continuous height field
  `H(cell)` (layered value noise + rocky-biome mountain spines, faded flat near spawn) is
  quantized into integer **storeys** (4 m each) and sub-storey **levels** (1 m). A monotone
  trickle-down **clamp** lowers each cell to at most `max_step` storeys above its lowest
  cardinal neighbour (diagonals may drop two — a valid formation). The clamp has a unique,
  order-independent fixpoint, so results are seed-stable. `compute_region()` batches a whole
  chunk's storeys+levels in two clamps and returns a `HeightfieldRegion`. Per-cell noise+carve
  samples are **memoized on the plan instance** (`_sample`, cleared by `set_raw_height_override`/
  `set_water_plan`) so the ~77 %-overlapping windows of successive chunk builds are sampled once —
  a pure-performance cache, output-identical. This remains the immutable natural planning
  input. Following the 2026-09-04 ground review, a sealed village publishes a finite
  `TerrainGradePatch` on its 3 m construction lattice. `WorldFeaturePlan` supplies that
  patch before final terrain sampling; it never mutates the natural plan or changes a
  loaded cell in response to streaming neighbours.
  - **Levels are rendered** (`RENDER_LEVELS = true`): adjacent same-storey cells may differ
    by one 1 m level, and that short step uses the same shared smootherstep surface patch as
    a 4 m storey slope. Levels do not emit cliff dressing or vertical backing walls.
- **`heightfield/HeightfieldRegion.gd`** — precomputed storey/level dictionaries with O(1)
  `storey_at` / `level_at` / `surface_height`. Same read API as the plan.
  Its final graded view composes the village's sealed ground-band and foundation-pad
  constraints through `TerrainGradePatch`, using the same centre/edge/corner smootherstep
  kernel for target heights. The finite collar applies the normal 12 m transition profile
  once to distance from the claimed-cell union, with continuous boundary-height blending;
  it never resmooths weights at every 3 m construction cell or switches nearest-pad owners.
  Natural fields remain available
  for deterministic site and parcel selection. The final view is shared by terrain visuals,
  collision and environmental dressing; foundation bounds use conservative interval
  composition rather than assuming a coarse natural quadrant still contains every extremum.
- **`field/TerrainSurfaceField.gd`** — reconstructs the **continuous walkable height** from a
  region. Each non-cliff cell quadrant is a smootherstep patch through four shared controls:
  its centre, the pairwise-minimum height at each adjoining edge midpoint, and the four-cell
  minimum at the corner. Both owners of an ordinary storey/level seam therefore compute the
  exact same boundary curve, including T-junctions where one neighbour slopes in a transverse
  direction. There is **no up-ramp**: a cell never rises to meet a higher neighbour — the
  higher cell is a flat **cliff top** and walls down vertically. Deliberate cliff/inner-corner
  discontinuities are filled by the mesher's rock skirts. Also the classifier for everything downstream: `_is_cliff_top`,
  `has_inner_corner`, `is_flat_cell`, `own_edge_flat`, `is_exposed_edge`, `is_higher_flat`,
  `edge_profile`. Ordinary slopes are single-valued on the shared grid, and adjacent chunks
  sample the same controls ⇒ **gap-free by construction** without miniature level walls.
  `height_bounds(region, footprint)` proves conservative extrema from the four corners of every
  clipped quadrant sub-patch (bilinear in monotone smootherstep coordinates); structural solvers
  use it instead of trusting a sample grid or inheriting unrelated far-away quadrant controls.
- **`field/TerrainChunkMesher.gd`** — builds one chunk (8×8 cells = 192 m, sampled at 2 m).
  `compute_chunk()` produces CPU-side mesh arrays, collision faces, and cliff placement data on
  the worker; `commit_chunk()` turns that payload into the chunk
  `Node3D` on the main thread. Its children are `Surface` (walkable grass mesh, visually clipped
  behind the cliff lips), a separate full-extent **collision** trimesh (the lip band stays
  walkable), `CliffFaces` (vertical **rock skirts** filling the gap under each flat cliff edge,
  double as wall collision), `Aprons` (ground continued under higher neighbours to seal recess
  slits), and `Cliffs` (the fixed cliff dressing). Ambient environment dressing is intentionally
  not part of the terrain payload. Quads are **pinned to their own cell** so cliff tops render flat
  to their boundary; the vertical gap is filled by the skirt. Classic inner-corner sheet points
  tuck below the rounded piece; any part of that tuck exposed by a low camera uses the same rock
  atlas texel as the wall, never bright grass. The walkable collision sheet is a
  raw `PackedVector3Array` fed to `ConcavePolygonShape3D.set_faces` (no `SurfaceTool`/trimesh
  cook). Much of this file is edge/lip/corner clip geometry — read the inline comments first.
  Its scale-independent `field_ground_surface()` adapter accepts any sealed lattice-height
  region and runs the identical `TerrainSurfaceField` centre/edge/corner kernel. Village turf
  and plaza caps use this path through `LatticeTerrainSurfaceRegion`: one-band changes are real
  welded smootherstep slopes, only true discontinuities receive a lip, and the committed surface
  uses the same ground-palette UV, biome tint, collision authority, and logical-cell metadata as
  streamed terrain. Village code must not rebuild grass panels or infer logical owners from the
  sub-quads produced by slope tessellation. The village's actual lip/corner layout also feeds
  the mesher's shared `_clip_vert` kernel, scaled by the lattice/module pitch; no separate
  garden rectangle trim is permitted. Only visuals retract beneath lips: collision retains
  the complete cell union. Concave tucked triangles carry `terrain_rock_vertices` through
  feature commit, preserving the normal terrain's rock backing instead of repainting it green.
- **`field/CliffDressing.gd`** — hangs real **KayKit** rock-wall + beveled grass-lip + inner/
  outer/step/junction **corner** pieces on cliff edges, batched into one `MultiMesh` per piece
  type per chunk. Visual only; the mesh skirt is the collision. `compute()` returns plain
  `Transform3D` arrays (unit-testable headless); `build()` turns them into nodes. Pieces snap to
  the **old-tile 10.5 grid** (3 m KayKit modules at ±1.5…±10.5, corners at ±10.5,±10.5).
- **`dressing/DressingField.gd`** — the pure deterministic ambient-nature field. Sets author
  direct per-biome fill rates, then shared `DressingHabitatLayer` fields form correlated groves,
  clearings, ecotones, rock exposures, and small colonies with true negative space. Optional
  jittered-Voronoi community fields keep nearby visual choices related instead of confetti-like.
  A separate world-wide `DressingEcology.land_occupancy01` mask is multiplied into every
  ground population, so broad clearings and the connected edges of a jittered-Voronoi graph form
  paths that no independent set can sprinkle back into. Mushrooms deliberately use a dense
  colony set plus a rare singleton set. Reeds are `EMERGENT` content: wet, inside the shoreline,
  and never scattered over dry land.
  Final jittered anchors are qualified against terrain and the shared `WaterFieldContext`, then
  bounded Matérn-II arbitration supplies local and cross-population spacing. Chunk ownership is
  half-open, so overlapping queries agree and seams cannot duplicate or omit an anchor. Worker
  payloads contain only asset IDs, transforms, and colours. At compile time every collidable
  choice is reduced to a resource-free radial stencil of its actual near-ground visual vertices;
  qualification rotates/scales that stencil and rejects roots, rock bases, or deadwood whose
  visible footprint would overhang a cliff, span excessive height, or cross water. That ordered
  compiled outline is transformed into a persistent static layer of the live grass deformation
  field around loaded structural dressing. It follows each asset's rotated/non-uniformly-scaled
  base instead of an oversized circular radius, keeping blades from passing through its mesh
  without coupling the worker fields. Authored-feature clearance is intentionally broader:
  every choice compiles its complete visual XZ bounds, then exact oriented-rectangle overlap
  rejects any tree crown, bush, rock, or future visual whose projection would enter a road or
  village reservation even when its anchor and grounded collision remain outside. The resulting
  `feature_query_margin` sizes only the feature-reservation lookup; it is intentionally separate
  from the finite terrain/water `query_margin`, so tall crowns cannot inflate water computation.
  `EnvironmentCollisionBuilder` commits
  baked static physics for structural nature before chunk readiness; `EnvironmentCommitQueue`
  creates one visual `MultiMesh` per `(asset_id, visual piece)` under a separate per-frame budget,
  and discards stale chunk generations. Dressing still owns no gameplay identity, interaction,
  persistence, navigation, or world-feature planning. Dense grass is intentionally separate;
  the former sparse `ambient_grass` dressing set is retired.
- **`grass/GrassField.gd` / `grass/GrassStreamer.gd`** — the deterministic, visual-only dense
  ground-cover pipeline. The pure worker field places a primary 17×17 jittered candidate lattice
  per 24 m tile, plus a deterministic supplemental lattice admitted in exact proportion to a
  slope's additional surface area. Instances use the sampled terrain normal as local up, so hills
  retain the flat-ground carpet density instead of exposing stretched XZ gaps. The field projects
  the slow biome/canopy/tint owners from a canonical world-aligned 3 m lattice,
  converts viable habitat through a narrow 0.20–0.42 monotone carpet curve while preserving
  exact-zero shared clearings. Open marsh and stronger habitat saturate, while weak margins reach
  zero quickly instead of exposing isolated repeated patches. It qualifies exact jittered anchors
  against paths, water, grade, and terrain.
  Path rejection covers the selected patch's full baked footprint, not just its centre. One
  generalized edge scale uniformly shrinks patches toward every ecological grass-bed margin and
  exposed upper cliff lip (both to 55% over the final 3 m), preserving blade proportions. Additional
  hashed layers are visited only by tiles containing such an edge. Moderate edges use
  `(1 + slope_area_extra) / edge_scale²`; total density is capped at four layers. Cliff
  classification is symmetric for one-sided surface-normal sampling, so the vertical discontinuity
  cannot falsely reject a strip as over-grade. The lower side is ordinary full-size carpet meeting
  an opaque rock wall; only upper-lip candidates taper, and their final shrunken footprint must
  stay on the walkable sheet. This prevents both a bare perimeter band and overhanging blades.
  Each tile selects one compiled asset variant and returns at most one packed CPU buffer. The
  current `stylized_grass.collection_05` source patch is bake-selected from a multi-variant FBX.
  All 311 blade silhouettes remain, but each indexed 18-triangle ribbon is reduced to a four-
  triangle root/bend/tip strip. The bake also moves complete blades 25% radially from the patch
  centre, producing one self-contained 1,244-triangle, roughly 3.11 m-wide mesh. Its large
  overlapping footprint closes the bed at far fewer instances than the former tuft grid. The main-thread
  service streams a 60 m full-density / 84 m fade / 108 m eviction ring and commits one shadowless
  MultiMesh per tile under an elapsed-time budget. Player distance owns deterministic population
  dropout and conservative CPU prefix caps; camera distance independently removes unreadable
  wind detail over 32–48 m, so an orbit camera cannot leave screen-distant blades
  sparkling. One double-sided shader also owns gentle height-relative sway, broad rolling gusts,
  and `TrampleField`'s world-anchored deformation. The bake stores each authored
  ribbon's local root in UV2, so trampling resolves blade groups instead of moving a whole 3.11 m
  patch as one tuft. A 1.1 m actor wake bends/drops grass strongly, retains at least 72% strength
  while moving, and recovers over 10 s. A separate persistent texture presses grass mostly
  vertically under loaded structural assets with a small radial outward spread. A fresh player
  trail owns the lateral direction and continuously blends back to that static crush as it
  recovers; no periodic obstacle stamp can snap it back. Both textures and their shared scrolled
  world origin publish atomically. Its base albedo directly samples
  the live texture object and grass-island UV owned by `terrain/materials/ground_palette.tres`,
  exactly like the terrain sheet. Collection 5 has no albedo
  texture; its relative light/dark structure comes from retained blade normals plus a nonlinear
  ground-matched contact/shaded-lower-growth/warm-tip ramp. Subtle root-group value variation fades out with camera
  detail, and the far field converges to the exact terrain value instead of retaining tiny tip
  marks or drawing a dark ring before the population cutoff. An 82% up-normal bias preserves nearby
  blade shading, then converges to the terrain normal with the same camera-detail fade; full
  roughness and zero specular bring the base colour into
  the terrain's lighting family. Back-facing ribbon cards flip their fragment normal into the
  same lighting hemisphere, avoiding dark double-sided stipple. The same projected
  `BiomeRegistry.ground_tint_at` field makes blades follow every biome transition and the shared
  broad 108/156 m intra-biome value/warmth patches.
  Grass has no
  collision, navigation, gameplay identity, persistence, or separate worker.
- **Paths and man-made features** (`scripts/terrain/features/`) — pure `SettlementPlan` owns only
  deterministic 768m future-village site identities and cells; it has no terrain API. `PathPlan`
  validates those sites against the untouched final fields, then owns canonical dry-landing bridge
  sites, monotone bounded route
  solves, local backbone/loop selection, and bridge/arch/lamp identities. `PathProgram` compiles
  the five demand-warmed assets and their primitive placement metrics; it contains no resources.
  Resource-free `FeatureProgram` composes path and village programs into the one canonical query
  margin, clearance, record-discovery reach, geometry halo, surface-priority table, field-cache
  budget, and sorted demanded-asset set. Streamer sizing therefore never reads a producer-specific
  limit. `WorldFeaturePlan` is the worker-facing owner and projects both canonical paths and
  complete village records; projection only selects already-decided ground shapes and half-open-
  owned placements.
  `FeatureContext` is the immutable per-block projection: `FeatureGroundField` always unions the
  O(1) path-grid layer with bucketed immutable circle/capsule/oriented-rectangle shapes, resolves
  surface paint by priority, and derives signed clearance from independent clearance shapes.
  Terrain, dressing, and grass consume only this general context; no path-only fallback remains.
  Future-village nodes validate a compact dry, supported footprint; their path-width square
  junction surface provides a gathering place without mutating terrain or stamping a circular
  plaza over the route. A node is a built junction: its square and arms meet at right angles and
  never take the open-country bend fillet, so a town's street and gate ramp butt against straight
  edges. Hot predicates use the same
  connection masks plus local shape buckets, so queries are O(1) in route length; lattice callers
  pass their already-known terrain cell to avoid repeating coordinate division. Each perpendicular
  arm pair adds a bounded quarter-annulus fillet, so both inner and outer path edges curve through
  turns and branches without a circle stamped over the junction. Path
  triangles keep the original tan; sparse varied-size world-hashed circular decals use one
  slightly darker tan from the same atlas island. The circles conform to the sheet and share its
  mesh, material, and draw call; exposed aprons use the base path tan. Path colour replaces the
  local 0.25m ground triangles in-place rather than riding on a second depth-fighting sheet.
  Mixed triangles partition at the existing feature field's continuous boundary; both paint
  owners share canonical crossing vertices, so curved corners are not whole-tile staircases;
  transition fans give adjacent coarse grass quads the same boundary vertices, so adaptive path
  edges cannot open T-junction hairlines. Bridges are
  exact-water-validated before becoming atomic route macro-edges; ordinary routes use cheap
  planning water, then validate only the selected corridor against exact water. Every ordinary
  route edge uses `TerrainSurfaceField.is_walkable_edge`, so a hill may be climbed over the same
  continuous sub-storey/storey slopes the mesher renders, but a route can never cut through an
  exposed cliff face. Existing cliffs beside an approach remain natural and optional; no shelf,
  ridge, cutting, or flanking cliff is manufactured for a village. Lamps face inward over the road.
  Large arches walk every accepted route from both village endpoints: the first attempt is centred
  84 m from the node, later segments supply bounded support fallback, and shared segments deduplicate
  while routes that split early each retain a gate. Small arches mark refined dominant-biome
  crossings, stay at least 144 m from a village and 96 m from another arch, so ecotone oscillation
  cannot make a gate stack. Precedence is
  bridge → village gate → biome gate → lamp. Stable feature
  IDs never include a streaming chunk or contributing route.
  The sectional warren system lives under `features/villages/fabric/`, with its diagnostic
  review scene in `tests/harness/warren_phase0_review.tscn`. The default production
  `VillagePlan` invokes `VillageWarrenFabricSolver`, which converts one sealed sectional
  plan into the canonical `VillageUrbanFabricPlan` and `VillageRecord`; topology is never
  re-inferred from render placements. Its production adapter coalesces the same canonical
  solid, walk, headroom, and guard cells into typed `VillageOccupancyVolume` cuboids; the
  broad district exclusion is supplementary, not a prefab-box replacement for those facts.
  `SectionalPublicRealmPlan` seals only typed exterior
  street, stair-canyon, undercroft, court, gallery, and short-bridge episodes plus their
  player-width seams, primary itinerary, loops, cover policies, and required interval
  classifications. A sealed maze source names two or three separated, at-grade exterior portals
  (the primary mouth first); production projects every one to an exact two-lane terrain street and
  heightfield-painted handoff rather than inferring exits from cul-de-sac degree. Each episode carries
  explicit exterior-air cells above its walk surface.
  `FabricVolumeClassifier` unions those claims with structural solids and inhabited volume,
  rejects every public-air/occupied-volume overlap, and flood-proves all public air back to the
  route landing. Passage rooms and occupied skywalks remain private building mass; building
  interiors and interior stairs are deferred and cannot satisfy public circulation. Ordinary
  `FabricUnit` records bind modular rooms, prefabs, markets, outcroppings, exterior facade
  stairs, roofs, and occupied overhead links through semantic sockets and a parent-before-child
  bearing DAG. `FabricModuleProgram` compiles each authored asset into a typed construction
  contract: even-cell footprints retain their half-cell phase, walk-surface visuals snap their
  authored top plane to the logical route plane, and roofs are sealed repeat runs with explicit
  pitch, profile, material family, and end seams. Every rotatable full crown preserves the exact
  world-space centre of its parent's finished floorplate; an even-cell quarter turn may change the
  roof's lattice origin, but can never shift the crown onto the adjacent 1.5 m phase. At final fabric sealing,
  `FabricContinuousRoofPlan` derives maximal straight roof chains only from exact matching run
  endpoints, bearing planes, transverse profiles, pitches, and seam profiles. Rooms retain their
  complete structural roof volumes, while realized construction removes the two internal gable
  caps at every proved join and selects one compatible repeat material for the entire chain.
  Compact-house crowns publish pre-aligned start, middle, and end alternatives for every reviewed
  material family. All three roles are clipped from one source crown around the same symmetric 3 m
  party-seam profile: each semantic 6 m construction bay emits two exact 3 m sections, while only
  the two exterior sections retain the
  source roof's measured outer eave. Provisional layout reserves the exact party span plus the
  complete transverse eaves and height; after component topology is known, the final plan proves
  the two actual exterior eaves against every unsuppressed placement. An explicitly socket-bound
  neighboring pitched roof may meet that realized skin only when the existing finite seam contract
  also proves the final world-space boxes; this preserves a real flashing junction without granting
  any exemption to undeclared roofs, walls, or retained stone. The only other exception is the
  named roof of a socket-bound facade bay on that same component, whose typed flashing joint is
  allowed while its walls and supports remain collision-checked. A joined chain is rebuilt as two
  exterior ends plus true middle bays on the one bearing plane,
  so adjacent complete houses cannot leave nested end caps, mismatched cut profiles, or change
  colour mid-ridge. Exterior end sections keep their complete source eave by default. When that
  finite eave would enter unrelated finished construction, the final transaction may select the
  corresponding pre-baked flush end whose bounds are a strict subset of the full end; the flush
  alternative is accepted only after it clears the same finished-fabric proof, so roof junctions
  are resolved by a valid authored construction choice rather than an overlap exception.
  Ambiguous branches and non-matching roofs remain separate; the renderer performs no proximity
  search, snapping, or per-mesh offset repair. A one-bay occupied bridge-house crown is two finite
  party-seam end halves: it terminates exactly at both endpoint planes while retaining its ordinary
  transverse eaves. Integrated crowns participate in the same roof alignment and connected-envelope
  rules as standalone roof units; lateral bearing parents never authorize a crown to continue inside
  endpoint stone or another roof. One-sided shed roofs additionally declare their authored high
  edge; the program aligns that edge to the parent wall before a recipe can seal. A paired shallow
  gable derives both inward-facing high edges from one shared ridge plane, so it cannot become an
  inverted valley through independent yaw choices. Measured
  visual-clearance envelopes reject
  unrelated mesh intersections, while explicit semantic visual seams are the only exception;
  those envelopes also feed the bounded filler search so invalid proposals are avoided before
  assembly. Layout code never repairs individual meshes with visual offsets.
  Rare reviewed palette variants reuse the exact source mesh and collision only through an
  explicit `EnvironmentVisualPiece.material_override`; variants that need the authored colour
  channel opt out of MultiMesh instance colour so the renderer cannot erase the remap input.
  `PublicRealmSurfaceSolver` unions only exterior terrain-street, structural-court,
  stair, gallery, and bridge claims; the assembler commits visual and collision faces from the
  same payload. Every rendered surface kind is also the sole owner of its horizontal boundary,
  so retained masonry cannot reappear as a rock cap in a street, stair, court, or bridge. A
  floor-facing retained boundary is sealed with an exact one/two-cell authored timber soffit,
  never an upright rock-wall module rotated into a horizontal shelf. Side masonry maps its
  measured 1.7701733 m face to the exact 1.5 m fine-grid claim and is inset by its measured half
  depth; perpendicular walls therefore meet at the lattice corner without protruding panels.
  A single occupancy-vertex rule seals concave and diagonal retained joints with one timber
  member per band; straight and buried vertices emit none. Facade alignment always presents
  the authored +Z exterior toward its declared normal. Full-width facade slots use full-width
  panels; proved perpendicular plain/window/door joins select baked finite miter ends (including
  handed variants), while straight repeats keep square ends. These clipped choices remain
  subsets of the original measured clearance envelope rather than adding overlap exemptions.
  Village turf is evaluated by the same `TerrainSurfaceField` kernel as streamed ground. Every
  capped yard and planned-green cell is emitted in one logical-cell union, with the complete
  public-surface union supplying its real neighboring height controls; invented equal-height
  rings are forbidden because they suppress exposed lawn edges. Only finished turf and public
  surfaces supply height controls; hidden retained blocks are structural occupancy, never a
  second ground-height authority that can pull a lawn through its timber substrate. Separate decorative panels
  may never own or omit a centre cell. Straight lips and corner lips use the same uniform
  lattice/module scale. Turf's top retaining course uses the matching terrain rock family,
  not square masonry protruding through its recessed rolled edge. A paired corner covers
  two named logical faces; every face retains its own exact inset wall collider, since
  terrain dressing meshes are visual-only. Rim audits count inner as well as outer corners.
  Rolled grass lips occur only on true exposed field edges, never at an
  equal-height turf/plank material seam. Like `CliffDressing`, a concave turn of an L-shaped lawn
  receives the authored inner-corner lip (rotated the extra half turn the kit needs) so the two
  straight lips round into each other instead of leaving a notch over the wall's corner block. A
  planted public deck over air uses a connected timber substrate instead of expanding
  one-band support markers into hanging stone courses. Grounded retained mass is preserved.
  Decorative facade caps bear with their authored underside on the wall-top plane, unlike
  walk-aligned public floors. Their visible tops cannot share the wall's horizontal faces.
  Its shared terrain clip kernel suppresses unbacked run-end drapes: grass cannot form
  a vertical curtain through the public air below a structural deck. A
  supported missing fourth cell in an otherwise complete 2 x 2 structural court is sealed as an
  explicit derived claim before surfaces, guards, or audits are built; closure cannot cascade
  across arbitrary empty space. When one sealed transition mesh owns both the upper and lower
  tread across a retained riser, it also owns that vertical seam and the generic stone skin is
  suppressed there; adjacent unrelated stair claims cannot open the massif. Every structural court, gallery, and bridge cell also carries the exact local
  envelope-ground support datum; renderer posts descend to that datum rather than an implicit
  global band zero, so a support cannot stop in air or continue through unrelated terrain. All
  low and tall post candidates derive from the complete final structural-surface outline vertices,
  repeat at the authored 3 m pitch, and are rejected when their thickness would enter any public
  lane below; internal surface seams can never manufacture posts in a plaza. The route entry also
  publishes ground-height constraints and path paint at each boundary. Production no longer
  emits separate town-street or handoff-ramp meshes: the terrain's fine local tessellation owns
  both their appearance and collision. Nearby accepted house pads join the same sealed grading
  transaction, retaining the neighbourhood while the collar meets untouched natural ground.
  Outskirts survey the finished field and propose pads on that same construction datum/grid
  before their entrance and route proofs. A later pad cannot overwrite a sealed ground band.
  After retained masonry is finalized, root rooms are re-proved against the actual
  six-neighbour ground-connected mass, not temporary source stone. Edge-only contact
  and pitched-roof bounding boxes cannot establish bearing. An otherwise unborne room
  requires four finite timber corner courses reaching the local support datum; every
  member passes the existing public-air and measured visual-clearance transaction.
  Every rendered exterior door
  requires both its exact threshold landing and a clear direct approach tile beyond every open
  facade half; a proposal that cannot provide that two-cell-deep approach is rejected before
  guards or facade assets are derived. Stair-span claims are not flat doorsteps: construction
  selects the existing closed facade when its doorstep lies on a flight or its approach
  crosses a flight's side rail, records the suppressed door IDs, and preserves the room
  envelope and stair guards. An aligned flight may lead through its open end to a flat
  doorstep. Prefab admission applies the same proof before reserving its mass, and surface
  sealing independently rejects any surviving unserved entrance. Courtyard planters have
  no minimum quota; only genuine outside corners qualify, with adjoining stair bands counted
  as route neighbours so furniture cannot occupy a flight's approach.
  Reviewed fixed-size floor/gallery meshes tile structural claims as authored plank
  visuals without replacing the union's collision authority or scaling assets. Production also
  emits the exact sealed structural union as a minimally recessed skin beneath those boards, so
  authored border insets cannot expose gaps while the authored planks retain their detail. The
  former short floor-bearer/corbel modules are not emitted: they read as unsupported stairs beneath
  overhangs, while boundary-derived posts and structural skins own the actual bearing. The same
  ruling (2026-09-04) removed the ribbed `sfv.fabric.brace.wood.002` corbel from every overhang:
  facade bays and bump-outs, skywalk ends, balconies, oriels, dormers, corner wraps, and the
  integrated room-jetty support courses. Those `outcrop.support.bracketed.*` recipes still seal and
  are audited once per bearing edge, but they carry no placements: they declare the exact envelope
  the corbels occupied (`FabricRecipe.set_local_clearance_bounds`) so every clearance proof keeps
  the same input while nothing is drawn. The diagonal-strut variants remain visible supports.
  Exposed court
  guards derive from that union and structural occupancy, so graph
  transitions stay open and arbitrary leftover gaps never become platforms. The proof first
  compiles a diagnostic seed, then `FabricSolidVoidPlan` turns every exposed route side into a
  boundary obligation. `StaggeredFabricEmbedder` runs a deterministic bounded beam over complete
  roof-closed one/two-storey envelopes at route, half-level-lower, and full-level-lower bases.
  `StaggeredFabricCompiler` turns proposals into ordinary terrain-perched room/roof DAGs; low
  edges that cannot fit a room may receive a complete baked market-stall envelope. The common
  transaction recomputes surfaces, exterior air, occupancy, and boundaries from the compiled
  units. It currently proves a connected exterior route with several rises and descents, a high court,
  private occupied skywalk mass above public space, zero public-interior episodes, zero
  public-air/occupied overlap, zero tents, and zero unclassified required intervals. Its
  adversarial capture harness validates both camera collision clearance and target line of sight;
  every full-resolution image receives one falsification disposition, and finding a real issue is
  explicitly a successful review. Sectional capture manifests carry raw and rotation-normalized
  maze signatures, construction signatures, and the hard stair/platform/entrance/support/overlap
  audit beside every image target; corpus coverage rejects repeated maze or construction geometry.
  The former v14 proof folded its upper journey and
  descent back through one denser mass, places the second occupied bridge-house directly over the
  lower route, renders structural surfaces with reviewed plank meshes, and shrinks the classified
  core from 40 x 50 to 30 x 36 lattice cells. It failed the 24 x 24 compactness budget,
  reconnecting-loop, frontage (53 of 138 exact boundary obligations closed), overhead, and
  sightline gates; these failures are intentionally
  preserved by the critical review harness rather than hidden by props or detached platforms. Its
  alignment revision treats exterior doors and deliberate floor openings as typed plan facts:
  an addressed room is selected only when its exact handed 1.5 m threshold has an adjacent public
  landing, and every real companion landing opens the remainder of the authored 3 m facade. Derived
  guards and endpoint posts open only across those actually claimed landing halves; an absent
  companion remains guarded exterior air rather than becoming an invented forecourt. Only an actual
  claimed landing proves the door reachable; otherwise the facade is closed/windowed. Collinear
  short guards along its shallow forecourt coalesce into one authored
  3 m rail with posts only at its outer ends, but only when the finished public surface owns both
  sections. The final
  `PublicRealmSurfacePlan` transaction hard-rejects every remaining unserved exterior threshold,
  so a visible door can never survive as a later diagnostic over empty air. Stair audits
  require both player-width lanes at their exact low/high graph seams. Structural courts satisfy
  bearing ancestry before surface compilation, while every reserved `DAYLIGHT_VOID` remains
  exterior headroom and receives derived guards. Guard openings are never inferred from arbitrary
  vertically adjacent walk cells, and missing geometry is never promoted to a platform implicitly.
  Fixed authored route seeds remain diagnostic fixtures only. Production runs the bounded
  procedural fabric search. Four orthogonal motifs, two turn phases, and four balanced vertical
  profiles form 32 seed-selected sectional grammar families before hashed construction choices;
  the exact and production corpora require different raw routes, rotation-normalized routes, and
  construction signatures. Exact visual selection compares two sealed survivors normally and the
  complete fixed eight-plan frontier only when the current best still has under 25% overhead route
  coverage or over 50 through-core sightlines. That vertical-coverage metric counts inhabited mass
  or a connected upper public surface crossing a lower route column; detached decoration never
  counts. Both
  compact-house families use true 3 m by 6 m narrow/deep envelopes
  with pitched roofs. Every rectangular generated house names local Z as both parcel depth and
  ridge axis, requires the measured roof to be longer on Z than its X eave span, and rotates the
  parcel/roof contract together; production cannot admit a sideways wide house. Complete authored
  3 m facade modules tile every side span with their source UVs. Timber panels own one edge post,
  so east/west faces use bake-time X-mirrored variants with corrected winding, normals, tangents,
  collision, and material surfaces. Runtime transforms remain proper rotations; rectangular shells
  must resolve to exactly one post at every corner, never doubled diagonal corners and empty opposite
  corners. Modular room stitches use the solid timber jamb fitted to a 0.28 m square,
  not the kit's plaster-bearing corner-wall panel. Every authored 3 m facade-bay
  endpoint is framed, including intermediate T-joints on long rooms; party-wall
  suppression must not leave an unstitched slot halfway along a room side.
  Every compact 3 m by 3 m modular room is also classified at the final fabric boundary:
  it must be a fully borne stack/foundation course, a two-ended occupied skywalk, or the roofed top
  of a compact house. Partial-bearing tower rooms, roofless compact houses, and unclassified
  micro-boxes reject the transaction; larger jetties remain governed by their separate exact
  bracket/support proof. The stackable townhouse may fill
  upper-route pockets without admitting sideways buildings. A greedy three-or-more-storey stack is
  admitted only after a lower complete roof-step neighbor already exists, and exact selection rejects
  every remaining unstepped tall stack. A narrow tall lineage is accepted only when it has a real
  world-space floorplate break releasing two or more facade planes and no identical plate runs
  for three storeys, so a deliberate 2+2 whole-room step is not mislabeled as a vertical extrusion;
  central height descends through occupied neighbors.
  Exterior stair-facade doors use the same cardinal threshold contract as
  other addressed rooms. A generated facade may render a door-shaped module only for a sealed
  exterior entrance or typed private feature portal, and every exterior entrance must have an
  exact public-surface claim at its threshold; decorative or midair facade doors invalidate the
  town. Finished static entrances always select reviewed closed-leaf assemblies. The stone assembly
  bakes the standalone arched leaf into the authored rock surround, so closing a threshold never
  replaces its masonry family with a plaster/timber wall; empty door frames remain catalogued only
  for a future interactive-door transaction. Outcropping vocabulary retains three exact scales.
  Production facade relief first tries a complete native-width 3 m gabled bay and falls back to the
  partial-height embedded oriel only where the larger measured envelope cannot preserve every
  unrelated room and finite roof closure. The assembler walks eligible facade courses in one
  canonical order and commits a maximal non-overlapping set, alternating full gabled bays and
  shallow bump-outs across accepted courses instead of independently rolling each feature. Failed
  measured-clearance proposals try the other relief family before yielding, so a seed cannot
  silently lose all of one vocabulary through presentation odds. The full-scale same-storey
  bump-out remains disabled: it is a
  3 m room plate shifted diagonally across a 3 m tower room: their shared 1.5 m quadrant remains the
  parent's authored shell, while only the exposed L-shaped union shell, floor, braces, and roof are
  emitted. It therefore reads as one compound building with no duplicate wall or texture in the
  overlap. A small facade bay is instead a 1.5 m-wide embedded oriel with 0.9 m return cheeks and a
  1.38 m partial-height face assembled from one normally proportioned authored S window. Identical
  centered timber jambs overlap the scaled centreline of the source panel's authored terminal post
  and its exact reflection rather than widening either edge; glazed return cheeks meet that same
  scaled face envelope at the parent seam. Its centered complete sill and shallow tiled canopy cover
  the complete narrowed face and both returns, the sill and
  canopy carry it visually (no corbel hangs below), and the parent remains a closed facade rather than opening a full doorway-sized
  hole behind the small bay. A straight room pasted beyond a facade,
  dormer, flue, or trim can satisfy neither massing contract. Its diagonal/corner-union recipes remain testable but
  their scale quotas are zero and production rejects any survivor which still requires a tower
  annex; they must not reappear through an implicit relief obligation. The optional bay search ranges across every eligible
  lineage and caps successful commits, so two initially cramped lineages cannot suppress relief
  elsewhere. Integrated upper-floorplate shifts still emit a `room_outcropping` fact, including
  directly borne shifts that need no brackets. A tower-to-slim/row size change computes its real
  bearing and extension before that outcropping classification: when exactly half of the upper
  plate crosses a two-band public-route bay, the solver seals an `arcade_overhang_support` as a
  four-corner frame of measured deck pillars, with explicit seams to both room plates. The frame
  occupies only the plate corners, so both 1.5 m public lanes remain open; a full 3 m stone arch is
  not used because its jambs stand on those lane centrelines. The shift may never pass as a
  zero-extension setback or receive loose decorative stone fragments. Ordinary
  shallow room jetties use compact wall-bracket courses; the full-storey diagonal asset is reserved
  for deliberately deep authored features because its long upright reads as a dangling pole when
  repeated below a shallow projection. Side panels sit on the actual one-module shell planes rather
  than leaving untextured gaps, never unroofed cubes, and markets draw only from the seven reviewed
  `stocked_market` prefabs;
  empty tent families are ineligible. The old terrain-massing planner and its compatibility entry
  point are removed; runtime village construction has one topology producer and one atomic
  transaction. The volumetric source-plan pipeline is the production path: the plot-model maze
  source described below. Before the town is built, `WarrenVillageScaleProfile.select()` deterministically chooses one
  of four size contracts: compact 65%, standard 25%, large 8%, grand 2%. **Task I8 (2026-08-30)
  set `radius_cells` to 5/6/7/8 after fixed-camera/player review showed that the restored
  7/8/9/11 footprints again dominated the character and surrounding world. Planning diameters are
  51/57/63/69 m in the production frame. The source macro lattice remains the authored 3 m
  module and its 1.5 m two-lane proof grid; `VillageWorldScale` maps the entire sealed transaction
  uniformly to a 6 m world macro / 3 m world fine lattice. One immutable 24 m terrain-field cell
  therefore contains exactly four town macro cells. The frame scales meshes, collision, semantic
  occupancy, route widths, supports, and terrain samples together; individual assets are never
  resized to repair a fit. Town extent changes only by admitting more procedural massif, street,
  plot, and outskirts opportunities.** Total
  inhabited-room budgets are 10--30/12--35/18--50/25--75; residual
  infill is capped separately at 6/6/8/12 rooms. Those totals include the late residual pass,
  which may never disappear from size accounting. Complete authored-building ranges are
  4 for compact, 3--4 for standard, 4--5 for large, and 5--6 for grand. A bounded deterministic compatible-set beam
  replaces the former hard-coded pair/triple enumeration, so the richer sets do not make generation
  exponential. The reviewed catalog contains 32 distinct complete meshes: twelve Stylized
  Fantasy Village interiors, seven tavern buildings, three alchemy buildings, two forges, seven
  Low Poly Fantasy Village houses, and its church. They compile as indivisible measured prefabs.
  The seven LPFV houses ship with an empty front aperture and a centred `_01` jamb frame, so each
  prefab recipe also owns one of the pack's two hinged `_02` closed leaves at the exact authored
  jamb/hinge transform; the leaf carries
  both visual and collision, while a retained clearance-only halo preserves the previously reviewed
  prefab envelope and keeps this visual correction from reshuffling bounded town search.
  Prefab admission uses unscaled 21/24/30/36 m maximum spans for compact/standard/large/grand,
  so a giant authored building cannot consume a compact town but the broadest silhouettes remain
  reachable in the larger profiles instead of being globally excluded.
  Buildings with the same occupancy,
  clearance, and socket signature share one topology proof but select a seed-varied visual
  representative afterward, so deduplication cannot freeze a footprint family to one mesh. The
  solver ranks compatible sets across the whole catalog before room composition. Source skywalk
  ranges are 2/2--2--3/3--4/4--5: larger towns request richer occupied-link sets and the sealed
  hero-feature ranking (exact composed recipe occluder route coverage, the same test as the final
  enclosure audit) keeps three only when the fourth provably adds no distinct inhabited route
  cover — that redundancy is recorded as an exact diagnostic fact. Balcony ranges are
  0--2/1--3/3--4/4--6; production full-scale diagonal-outcropping ranges are temporarily zero for
  every size. Compact and standard towns take a covered market only when their ground street
  holds the complete measured transaction; large and grand require it and the elevated
  third-storey court. Stable source signatures and
  terrain-relative rebuilds carry the exact selected profile; a small town is never a cropped or
  mesh-scaled large one. The smaller footprint is produced at source-plan time, before streets,
  plots, or buildings exist; it is not a camera accommodation or a crop of a finished result.
  **THE PRODUCTION PIPELINE IS ONE PASS.** There is no generation mode, no attempt rotation, no
  ranked candidate frontier and no solution pin: task F1 deleted the searched pipeline outright
  (`WarrenTownSolver.GENERATION_MODE`, `WarrenPublicRealmCarver`, `WarrenGroundArcadeSolver`,
  `WarrenExcavationCarver`, `WarrenParcelizer`, `WarrenParcelHeightSolver`,
  `WarrenSolidPartitioner`, `WarrenBuiltTownSolver`/`WarrenBuiltTownPlan`, `WarrenTownPlan`,
  `WarrenAssetPlan`, `WarrenFabricCompiler`, `WarrenMassPruner`, `WarrenVolumeSurfaceCompiler`,
  `WarrenSolutionPinCache`, and the hero-feature beam inside `WarrenVolumetricSolver`). A settlement
  is built exactly once per (city seed, scale profile), and if it is rejected there is no second
  candidate -- which is why every richness quota below is an audit fact rather than a refusal.
  The call graph is: `VillagePlan` -> `VillageWarrenFabricSolver.solve` (terrain sampling, yaw
  placement, materialization) -> `WarrenVolumetricSolver.solve` -> `WarrenMazeSitePlanner.plan`
  (massif -> carve -> reserve -> partition -> seal) -> `WarrenMazeVolumeAdapter.to_volume_plan` ->
  `WarrenVolumetricSolver.from_volume` (public volume, parcels, rooms, one-pass feature selection,
  residual backfill) -> `WarrenSpatialFabricCompiler.solve` -> `SettlementFabricAssembler`. The
  terrain rebuild after placement (`solve_selected`) is the identical one-pass solve with the
  placement's real ground bands.
  The corpus sweep is `tests/harness/warren_maze_mode_sweep.gd`, run as
  `Godot --headless --path . -s res://tests/harness/warren_maze_mode_sweep.gd -- --seeds
  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 --scale compact,standard,large,grand`. It writes its matrix to
  `res://.godot/warren_maze_mode_sweep.json` with a fingerprint of the fabric script directory, and
  `tests/test_warren_maze_composition.gd::test_corpus_composes` scores itself against that file
  and refuses a matrix measured against a different tree. `--mode` and `--constructive` are
  retired and now exit 2 rather than silently no-opping. The full four-scale run is MANDATORY:
  `--seeds` is global, so a per-scale reduction cannot be expressed and a short matrix
  hard-fails the corpus gate. Corpus figures are regression measurements, never generation inputs;
  refusals remain named composition, public-air, roof, or bearing gates rather than seed exceptions.
  The focused five-town life corpus after the scale/connectivity revision realizes ten occupied
  skywalks and zero unsupported/floating modular rooms. Source spans are selected with two complete
  ground-reaching endpoint-house proofs; exact roof or envelope conflicts release the whole span
  rather than leaving a floating body or intersecting textures.
  Per-stage wall clock for one town is on the
  sealed plan's `maze_stage_ms` audit
  key; `tests/harness/warren_maze_stage_probe.gd` and `warren_solve_profile.gd` print it.
  `WarrenMazeCarver` builds one deterministic entrance-to-summit spine,
  coverage-driven alley network, a universal typed 6 m by 6 m market square, and open-air/tunnel
  classification from the same `WarrenMassif`,
  using the shared resource-free stride geometry in `WarrenPassageLatticeRules`. Its sealed
  `WarrenMazeSourcePlan` is the prospective pre-`WarrenVolumePlan` authority: every public cell has a
  typed spine/alley/market owner, one universal market-zone prefix, a block-thickness classification, and a
  deterministic signature covering graph, air, and thickness state. The source seal requires one
  exterior entrance, connected valid passage strides, capped straight runs, and at least 90% of
  public cells retaining an inhabitable facade. It reports addressed-column reach and raw-solid
  survival separately; the design's mass ratio is the later partition's share of post-carve SOLID,
  not the fraction of the original massif left after intentional passage/shaft excavation. The
  `WarrenMazeVolumeAdapter` seals a bidirectional bore/surface alignment audit before exposing the
  common volume: every nominal passage cell retains at least two fine floor lanes, every emitted
  floor remains inside the actually carved passage column/slot, and the second tread band of a
  stair is recorded separately rather than misclassified as an invented path.
  market widens a straight approach by two cells when possible and otherwise fills the missing
  diagonal of a tight approach turn; alley growth treats that square as immutable topology and
  restores the source frontage margin around it. `WarrenMazeBlockPartitioner` is the town's only
  parcel stage, reached through `WarrenTownSolver.partition_parcels`. It translates the sealed
  source's plots into the existing authored tower/slim/row/building/long parcel contracts in one
  deterministic pass and generates no partition variants: the leftover solid already IS the
  buildings, so nothing has to be fitted around the route.
  `WarrenMassifBuilder` authors the one bounded 2--18-band **inhabited** mountain directly above
  immutable terrain; `WarrenMassif.bearing_at()` is the terrain base, never a hidden stone
  substrate. Its height law uses the footprint's continuous Gaussian value plus
  two coherent integer-hash noise octaves, quantized to whole storeys under a
  monotone riser clamp. Finite terrace regions are bounded before columns are
  emitted, then small regions coalesce once without erasing a height level.
  `WarrenMassifBuilder.build()` constructs one field and freezes it; the former
  128 seed phases, preferred/fallback candidates and completed-field quality
  gate are removed. `WarrenMassif.validate_construction()` inspects connectivity
  separately for tests. The 10,000-field inspection harness checks core height,
  five-level minimum, riser bounds, clustering and plateau limits independently.
  Before residual massif becomes renderable stone, a deterministic macro-lattice erosion lowers
  every complete top course of unclassified retained rock which has no cardinal structural
  neighbour and nothing borne above it. Both derived hillside and plot mass which became no
  building participate; rooms, roofs, features, public surfaces, prefab envelopes, and structural
  bearing are already claimed and therefore cannot be removed. The pass iterates to a local
  fixpoint, so an isolated raw 3 m cube cannot survive while a two-column ridge or a complete,
  supported, roofed one-cell building remains legal.
  When a complete source-rock course is the terrain-bearing endpoint of an occupied bridge-house,
  it is promoted into the authored lower storey of that same building lineage; it never survives
  as an undecorated stone cube immediately below the upper room and roof.
  Within a partition, macro room bearing is repaired and hard-rejected before the more expensive
  registration/silhouette relief; a source macro preflight performs that proof before the hero
  feature beam, and the final transaction repeats it afterward. A merged room may carry a source
  lineage upward only when the resumed authored floorplate is fully borne or has one exact
  bracketable bay--a one-cell incidental overlap is never a support seam. Registration relief
  scores the exact exposed shoulder before facade variation and may never replace a roofable seam
  with an arbitrary voxel shelf; complete room crowns, compound gables, and bound lean-to runs are
  the only admitted shoulder vocabulary.
  After every required feature campaign and before optional facade bays, every one-cell residual
  course trapped between occupied party walls must compile as exactly one typed
  `interstitial_join` construction — a stepped-shoulder lean-to (bearing bond into the room
  below's exact top socket, ridge on the single continuing wall) or a measured
  `interstitial.seal` strip (flush-capped to the sky, timber-blocked under bridging mass) — or
  the town is rejected with a reason-coded refusal. Coincidental mesh adjacency is never a seam,
  a shoulder may never bear on another strip, and the final audit proves
  `one_cell_interstitial_gap_cell_count == 0` on every sealed plan.
  A successful exact hero-feature room composition is carried into final partitioning instead of
  recomputing the same deterministic result, unless feature-envelope displacement changed its
  input parcel set. Exact construction
  assigns blue/orange/amber timber families through deterministic jittered-Voronoi architectural
  districts about 18 m across, so neighbouring houses and vertical lineages read as related quarters
  instead of per-room colour confetti. Blue and amber quarters take cool slate roofs; orange quarters
  retain warm roofs, deliberately counterbalancing the two compact authored tower roofs whose honest
  source textures are both orange. Storey phase still changes complete authored wall modules and
  measured facade details. Construction admits only explicit compatible party-wall seams. A sealed
  `PARTY_WALL` may suppress a facade placement only when all four fine-grid faces behind that one
  complete 3 m authored wall module meet private volume; partial contacts retain the whole module.
  Suppression is stored on `FabricUnit`, validated against its recipe, enters the construction
  signature, and is applied before asset demand/placement expansion, so the renderer never guesses
  proximity or draws coincident timber/stone skins. Touching equal-height room roofs are solved as
  one atomic neighborhood transaction: continuous ridges, measured valleys, and stepped wall joins
  are legal only when the complete authored neighborhood fits. A collision cannot rewrite that
  neighborhood into flat architecture; it rejects construction while proposal selection can still
  choose different massing. Complete terminal house plates therefore receive pitched roofs.
  Only a complete `roof.terminal.tight.*` gable may satisfy that terminal obligation;
  `roof.terminal.step.*` and `roof.terminal.profile.*` remain facade/junction seam vocabulary and
  can never masquerade as a whole-room roof. The reversible source-plan gate derives every
  complete candidate with the same phase-aligned origin and exact public-air test as final roof
  assembly. Every roof obligation enters the layout transaction even when that candidate list is
  empty, so an impossible optional parcel is displaced (or the layout rejects) before commit rather
  than losing the obligation and reaching the renderer roofless or embedded in retained stone.
  Flat/cap vocabulary is reserved for typed public terraces, circulation backing, and partial
  setback closure whose finished topology already requires a level surface; it is never a collision
  repair or an exposed plank weather roof.
  Partial setback strips prefer an honest exposed-edge rail; enclosed strips may receive a measured
  planter-only roof garden, and every dressed form has the exact plain cap as its transactional
  fallback. A changed upper floorplate is accepted only when every exposed shoulder is either one
  complete standard room footprint, an exact wall-bound lean-to row, or a lossless compound
  partition of complete house crowns plus native terminal strips. The roof compiler consumes that
  same partition largest-first with at most one recognizable gable crown per parent shoulder;
  arbitrary branching voxel shelves are rejected or an optional
  crown is truncated. A compound gable does not exempt neighboring rooms from measured visual
  clearance, so a valley collision selects the matching plain shell or one coherent flat service
  closure instead of overlapping roofs. True one-storey tower/slim closers preferentially use their integrated chimney roofs.
  Adjacent compact roof ends are editor-baked to exact 3 m runs: each keeps its authored exterior
  gable and terminates at the shared open party seam, so equal-datum neighbours touch without
  overlap or runtime scaling. Compatible one-valley building/long T-neighbourhoods use the existing
  atomic bisected-host/open-branch construction; a compact crossing which has no authored watertight
  junction rejects the atomic construction instead of overhanging or flattening its 3 m house.
  Pitched compact and slim roofs may receive measured dormers. Each uses one complete authored
  attic-window shell, retaining its window, cheeks, sill, supports, and closed gabled or shed crown
  as one coherent asset. The reviewed steep gable stays at 56% scale; the broader shed uses 50%,
  a lower 0.22 m registration, and a 0.22 m downslope shift so its tail stays below the host ridge.
  The blue compact tower retains the reviewed steep
  gable; the warm compact tower uses the lower-profile shed instead of the weaker shallow gable.
  Gabled and lower-profile shed families use separate registrations so their feet and open backs remain buried in the host slope without
  hiding the glazing or exposing a roof hatch. Compact/wide eave offsets are 1.15/2.15 m.
  Long roofs may select a bilateral recipe with one dormer on each opposing pitch. True wraparound
  balcony recipes own two continuous 3 m deck rows, a native half-width third cell on the direct
  doorway circulation line, a 1.5 m side return, nine exposed-boundary guard sections, two
  complete one-storey timber pillars beneath real outer deck cells, and a planted corner. The
  doorway seam and both of its guard endpoints are keep-clear zones, so neither the direct rail
  nor an adjacent repeat's terminal post can block the aperture; structural supports sit off the
  doorway axis. Their complete authored stair is a
  switchback, not a two-lane straight flight: one measured low tread lands on an existing
  `PUBLIC_FLOOR`, the opposite high tread meets the deck through one exact guard opening, and the
  module contract aligns the high tread plane rather than the taller handrail AABB. Compact and
  deep walk-out balconies use a four-cell-wide platform with the doorway in an inner bay, at least
  one full cell of lateral clearance to each side guard, one complete 3 m centre guard plus two
  complete 1.5 m end guards, and four measured supports. The nearest side-railing terminal post
  therefore cannot sit on the threshold, and both front-guard joins sit at the outer quarter points
  rather than on either handed doorway axis. Balconies are never
  inferred from an accidentally exposed lower roof. None of these private visual treatments invents
  public walkability. Every candidate's
  complete transformed semantic solid volume is checked against the sealed 3D public-air grid—not
  just its first band—and every collidable authored placement is checked against the player-width
  protected lane inside that air. Shallow eaves may still brush a route cell's outer corner, but a
  gable or eave entering the walkable body lane rejects that roof candidate.
  An unsupported or unresolved multi-valley result rejects the construction before materialization;
  no late pass flattens roofs or emits a fictional pitched-junction module. Stone is concentrated
  at real terrain bearing and retaining work; a sparse building-level rule may continue that masonry
  through the first upper storey as a coherent plinth, but never as arbitrary high cladding or a
  hidden podium. The sparse rule now offers one in three complete low lineages, in deterministic
  hash order, but admits them only while their exact exterior-face contribution stays at or below
  22% town-wide; the bound is computed before material selection, so a compact town with one large
  candidate cannot turn into a fortress and masonry never fragments panel by panel. When any column of a generated building needs that plinth, the complete building
  footprint receives one shared bottom course with a closed four-sided perimeter; every module is
  source-mass-backed and its lowest edge meets terrain or an authored path surface. Individual
  facade patches and floating partial courses are invalid. A house footprint may span at most the
  explicit one-storey plinth budget in sampled terrain height; larger risers must split into
  narrower terrain-rooted buildings rather than becoming masonry podiums. The buildable frontier
  is the tapered 3D envelope's real capacity boundary, never a radial outskirts ring. An outer
  parcel whose shallowest boundary column has deeper massif immediately behind it is capped to one
  storey plus roof at that edge, then gains one storey per inward boundary-depth ring. An isolated
  edge house with no deeper neighbour is not shortened. This puts occupied foreground roofs in
  front of taller mass instead of leaving one flat vertical city face. Every
  frontier parcel must either reach terrain directly or be the one typed 3 x 6 m covered gateway;
  optional terrain-level residual houses require a multi-face connection to already established
  circulation, preventing unsupported one-cell tails around the edge. The gateway's
  one bay is terrain-borne while the other crosses an already-authored lower route and its exact
  headroom, with a measured bracket/diagonal support reserved in the same transaction. An
  unsupported frontier parcel invalidates the whole parcel plan. Large and grand
  topologies must also contain one typed 6 x 6 m third-storey courtyard: its floor is four bands
  above the local terrain, supported by complete mass or a lower route, and addressed by buildings
  on at least three sides. The court additionally reserves explicit open-sky columns and proves
  actual public walk surfaces both below and above its XZ projection; swept headroom alone never
  counts as the over-court route. The
  final exact selector also recognizes broad irregular roof courts assembled by the ordinary room
  transaction. A court must contain at least twenty connected 1.5 m floor cells, meet the canonical
  upper route through a player-width seam, remain irregular rather than a narrow strip, and bear on
  multiple occupied buildings. The courtless-fallback rule that used to sit here -- retain the
  first valid courtless candidate while compiling the next three ranked partition variants -- was
  a property of the searched frontier and died with it in task F1. There is one partition and one
  composition, so a compact or standard town either forms its route-connected roof court or ships
  without one, and the shortfall is published.
  The
  fine-grid volumetric front end selects exactly one covered market and its measured
  skywalk set before room composition, in one pass and without a search
  (`WarrenVolumetricSolver._maze_feature_pass`). Straight and corner skywalk recipes share an explicit blue
  or orange roof campaign; an L-link chooses the corner matching its arms (mixed arms resolve to
  slate), so the turn cannot expose a one-piece warm patch inside an otherwise cool roof. The market attaches the atomic 6 x 3 m reviewed canopy plus
  authored stocked-table recipe to one exact terrain-rooted room `MARKET` socket. Four central
  public cells remain negative space beneath the canopy; when their lattice phase does not already
  meet one route episode, a bounded two-cell-wide aisle throat is carved to a two-lane seam. Every
  aisle cell is newly carved canonical `PUBLIC_AIR`, carries its public floor and named construction
  seam, and is projected by `WarrenSpatialPublicRealmAdapter` as one supplemental covered route
  node. The market body, aisle, terrain bearing, visual clearance, backing room, and construction
  record commit atomically; its decorated variant keeps a measured leafy plant in one post bay and a
  barrel with tabletop lantern in the other, outside the four-cell aisle. Room/roof packing and the
  skywalk beam must yield to that reservation. The final room transaction recomputes support from
  the complete surviving partition. An unsupported ordinary elevated building may yield only as one
  complete lineage/dependent closure; market, court, skywalk, and other exact feature sockets veto
  that fallback, so neither a doorway nor an upper-room fragment can remain floating.
  Candidate order measures bounded sight rays from every aisle edge and prefers the arcade whose
  views terminate in inhabited mass soonest, before considering room displacement, so cheap empty
  perimeter space cannot pull the bazaar out of the city. A canopy may meet the underside of an
  existing upper public route: that already-sealed `PUBLIC_FLOOR` is the single shared interface,
  rather than being overwritten with a duplicate roof claim. All other market face conflicts still
  reject the transaction. The exact market/court/landmark/skywalk preflight also recomposes the
  rooms and rejects any survivor that still contains more than two consecutive storeys with an
  identical tower floorplate unless that exact lineage carries the hard quota of two occupied,
  roofed room annexes. The feature transaction rejects the entire town when even one required annex
  cannot seal, so the exception changes the building silhouette rather than disguising it with props.
  Three-storey narrow houses receive one such occupied annex. The composition records are one storey
  each, so a forced second storey does not
  accidentally protect an optional third-storey crown from truncation. That check runs inside the
  bounded hero-feature loops, while another court or market candidate can still be selected, rather
  than after the first superficially compatible set has become irreversible. Tower-risk ordering uses
  that same three-storey repetition threshold rather than the separate four-storey annex threshold.
  Exact room-preflight failures are cached within one market candidate by the complete court body,
  clearance and forced offsets; landmark protected cells; skywalk components, owners, clearance,
  priority and forced offsets; and required transition owners. Authored palette recipe names are
  deliberately absent, so visually different prefabs reuse a proof only when every consumed 3D
  composition fact is identical.
  When exact composition proves that the selected court's forced parcel/block/offset obligation
  creates even one repeated shaft, the remaining visual variants of only that identical obligation
  reuse the failure, even when the same composition reports additional unrelated bad lineages. Other
  court geometry and other market sites remain searchable. A failure owned only by unrelated rooms
  is never promoted into a court-wide shortcut.
  The four typed third-storey court nodes
  retain explicit owner identities through public-realm projection; the visual adapter tiles only
  their exact 6 x 6 m union with alternating reviewed 1.5 m boards. Collision still comes from the
  common sealed surface union, and no court is inferred from the shape of an arbitrary platform.
  The one-pass feature selection (`WarrenVolumetricSolver._maze_feature_pass`) stamps the
  scale-selected zero, one, two, or three reviewed prefab landmarks before generic rooms, from the
  asset plots the source placed -- it does not search for them. Compact towns keep identity inside the connected room
  mountain instead of appending a detached manor. Each anchor is a complete measured terrain-rooted recipe with its real baked
  entrance aligned to a canonical ground-street landing, conservative shell/private volume,
  visual envelope, exact contact-point bearing cells, doorway face, and construction transform.
  Its source siting transaction publishes every massif column touched by that measured body/eave
  reach plus a street-side future-house buffer. Generic parcel partitioning may reuse those columns
  only above the prefab's top, so a selected complete asset cannot be displaced by a later low house
  while higher terrace mass remains legal. The exact terrain-bearing columns are separately carried
  through the final shoulder rebuild. An asset source plot is only this coarse measured search and
  clearance reservation: after the prefab claims its real body, every unused cell in that plot
  envelope is released to exterior air rather than retained as a full-height stone box. Support
  below the prefab floor remains typed rock, so the landmark stays grounded without a quarry block
  wrapping its walls.
  Candidate pairs may touch across a canonical face only through the joint transaction's explicit
  deterministic `PARTY_WALL` (horizontal) or `CONSTRUCTION_JOINT` (vertical) claim. Both landmark
  transactions reuse that one canonical joint owner, so measured anchors can form coherent dense
  fabric without double-claiming exterior facades or accepting a mesh overlap. Candidate
  pairs rank by their measured contact
  with surviving ordinary room mass on multiple sides before parcel displacement, surplus corridors,
  separation, and visual variety. Blocked parcels and other hero features never count as that contact,
  and the exact terrain-rooted transition houses which do count become required members of the final
  room transaction. Ranking precomputes the
  exact blocked-skywalk index set for each individual landmark and unions those sets per pair; this is
  an exact factorization of the former pair-by-skywalk collision loop, not a shortlist. Identical
  ordered candidate corpora reuse their complete pair frontier across court variants, while every
  court-specific skywalk score is recomputed. This keeps a landmark
  from winning merely because it preserves dozens of links when production needs the selected count;
  arbitrary detached prefabs are never added after packing. Large/grand landmark groups require at
  least one enclosed skywalk to terminate in a real landmark
  ROOM/BEARING socket. That intentional two-cell interface is the only deferred landmark shell
  seam, and the skywalk owns both the open face and its persistent clearance halo so later balconies
  and roofs cannot pierce it. Landmark-owned private cells are feature volume rather than synthetic
  `WarrenBuildingVolume` stacks, and their terrain bearing replaces any hidden support podium.
  The exact hero preflight also mirrors final phase-A/phase-B room-envelope selection for every
  unrelated room pair. If both measured facade phases collide, it may drop one complete optional
  parcel and re-run the transaction; it may never drop an addressed/court/market/skywalk parcel or a
  selected landmark-transition house. Room overhangs are preflighted together with the exact
  measured bracket or arcade course that will bear them. When that support envelope intersects a
  fixed market/court/skywalk feature, an ordinary optional parcel may still yield as a whole. A
  required lineage instead feeds the exact upper-room cells back through the semantic
  `ROOM_SUPPORT_CLEARANCE_OWNER_ID`: because composition records are one storey each, the planner
  can terminate only an unforced crown above the last required room even when the earlier offset
  packer grouped both storeys in one coarse band. This is a structural load-path transaction, not a
  mesh offset or visual repair; a collision at or below a required socket rejects the candidate.
  The covered-market backing phase is selected by one helper shared by candidate validation, exact
  preflight, and final composition, and the recomposed room probe must still contain its exact typed
  backing cell after every crown retry. The audit separates feature-clearance displacement,
  room-pair displacement, support-clearance crown termination, and the persisted exact exclusion
  cells.
  `WarrenRoomCompositionPlanner` then treats every remaining upper band as a mutable 3D room field,
  never as a 2D parcel to extrude. Its deterministic band tiler may replace adjacent source-lineage
  blocks with one measured long/slim/square room when the exact occupied-cell union, support overlap,
  protected reservations, and later lineage handoffs all remain valid. A second residual-mass pass
  can grow a room into genuinely unclaimed inhabited massif cells beyond its source footprint; an
  addressed upper room is eligible only when the transformed authored door and exact public frontage
  remain unchanged. If an unforced crown can no longer fit around a hero reservation, composition
  may terminate the lineage after its last required storey, subject to the two-storey tower cap; it may never discard or truncate
  through a later door, court wall, market socket, or bridge endpoint. The selected court's occupied
  bridge-house body and final recomposed room cells must still address three distinct sides before
  any building is committed—source parcel silhouettes do not count. Cardinal adjacency is deliberately not rejected by a blanket fine-cell moat:
  exact cell ownership protects topology, compatible contact becomes a typed party wall, and the
  selected recipes' measured envelopes decide sub-cell eave/facade clearance. A recomposed addressed
  room derives its authored door phase from the final world origin, yaw, frontage, and threshold;
  inheriting the source parcel's half-cell phase is forbidden because it can move a door 1.5 m away
  from topology. Stone upper storeys participate in the same finite balcony/skywalk portal variants
  as timber families. Skywalk constraints
  preserve the exact authored centre-facade room socket rather than accepting any perimeter cell.
  After hero composition, a bounded residual 3D backfill stamps complete one-storey rooms into
  remaining inhabited cells. It ranks genuinely new occupied cover over public route cells first,
  accepts either the selected room recipe's exact transformed public threshold or a private parent
  edge (mere adjacency to a street is not a doorway), and requires terrain or an
  existing building for physical bearing. The selected scale caps both its total and per-kind room
  count, and those rooms are added to the final inhabited-room budget. Exact roof clearance remains the construction contract;
  an additional symmetric eave halo prevents a later facade or roof from rising through an earlier
  pitched eave without forbidding legal same-height roof meetings. The residual pass is ordinary
  building volume, never decorative mass, and its audit reports newly covered route cells and newly
  closed street-frontage sides independently.
  Storey diversity is audited from world-space floorplate columns rather than room
  kind or local origin, because even-cell rotations and origin changes can describe the same visible
  shaft. No accepted lineage may retain more than two consecutive identical tower floorplates, and
  no accepted tall lineage may remain a repeated world-space extrusion. Every occupied
  composition feature owns private volume through the same sealed exact-reservation contract; final
  ownership validation is intentionally feature-kind-agnostic. Full-scale annex/corner-union recipes
  remain diagnostic-only and have zero production quota; no dormer, straight pasted-on room, flue bay,
  or other decoration may silently substitute for them.
  After exact room composition, the same fine grid admits the scale-selected number of usable
  balconies across multiple building owners. Each is one measured L-shaped private occupied-floor recipe with
  two full-width deck rows, a third doorway-throat cell, a half-depth return, full two-band headroom, a
  reviewed door facade, nine exposed-boundary railing sections, two full-storey diagonal supports, one
  exact authored switchback stair, one exact room/bearing socket, and a named visual seam to only its
  source parcel stack. Selection permits at most two per building and forbids equal XZ/facing
  facade coordinates at different heights, so balconies cannot recreate a vertically repeated
  tower pattern. Their body, visual clearance, room endpoint, guard/open-seam/soffit faces, support,
  and construction transform commit atomically before roof selection. Candidate admission compares
  the balcony's authored AABB with both possible facade phases of every unrelated final room, so a
  lattice-clear bracket or eave cannot clip neighbouring construction. It also compares that exact
  AABB with every earlier feature construction record—especially the diagonal and shallow support
  courses owned by room-scale outcroppings—because those oblique meshes are not represented by the
  private-volume raster alone. Complete terminal room crowns also publish their finite measured
  gable alternatives into this admission pass; an optional balcony is rejected when it would block
  every valid roof for any house, rather than being discovered after reservation. Measured brace clearance may
  enter lower public air only as an explicit covered-street construction seam, and a brace foot may
  pass below the grid only within its horizontal bounds so it visibly embeds in immutable terrain.
  Flowered balconies
  are separate measured recipes rather than props stamped onto the plain structural form; the same
  transactional rule owns the garden versions of stocked markets and the planter/flower variants
  of roof terraces and setback gardens. Their five reviewed flower families remain inside each
  recipe's visual-clearance and fallback contract.
  Diagnostic whole-room outcroppings are either shifted final upper-room floorplates or same-storey
  diagonal corner unions, never small houses pasted beyond a facade. Production currently selects
  neither form. Each diagnostic recipe owns roof, floor, exposed side shells, and support while the
  corner union deliberately omits its shared parent quadrant. Small embedded
  oriels use an authored shallow tiled eave rather than a bare deck cap. A diagonal corner union uses
  two opposed, end-trimmed authored low pitches whose measured high edges meet exactly as one convex
  gable; the clipped runs preserve the exterior eaves while removing the decorative curls that used
  to overlap at the seam. It therefore avoids the old wooden tabletop, a concave valley, and two
  complete roofs crossing as a pinwheel. The preferred support is a measured
  diagonal timber course whose full 3D sweep must avoid public/daylight/service air, unrelated rooms,
  and feature clearance; a shallow bracket course is the explicit fallback, never horizontal trim
  masquerading as structure. Every accepted cantilever is either directly terrain/building-borne or
  owns one of those exact support courses; odd 4.5/7.5 m bearing edges close with an authored
  one-brace terminal after their complete 3 m courses, never a scaled brace. A room with no direct
  bearing remains invalid. After every room has been composed, the planner re-audits the final 3D
  solid claims rather than trusting proposal-time ancestry: it may relocate an unsupported
  floorplate, hand the load to a lower parent floorplate, or omit an optional terminal crown, while
  exact door and skywalk interface rooms remain fixed. The final audit permits zero unsupported
  room transitions, unresolved cantilevers, or irregular projections.
  The assembler recognizes disjoint upper walk surfaces across existing exterior air. It claims
  every disjoint lower-public-street crossing first, then may add separately valid upper open-air
  lanes; every supplement obeys the same two walkable end bearings, gap, and headroom proof and
  never replaces a real street crossing. Even runs of complete 3 m bays, up to three bays long,
  become 3 m-wide enclosed pitched-roof bridge-houses: complete tiled floors, complete windowed
  side walls, and one compact roof repeat per bay. The source span, its two endpoint rooms, occupied
  bridge room, lower public-air tunnel, and support ancestry are one topology compound before public
  air is carved. The source transaction reserves the complete inhabited body, both endpoint shell
  interfaces, and the complete repeated roof envelope before ordinary room composition; later
  feature reservations merge with those claims and may not replace them by priority. The bridge
  room's exact recipe integrates its two-ended supports, inhabited body, and one full compact roof
  repeat per source bay, including both authored eaves. The source endpoint-to-roof seam identity is
  carried through room recomposition into the final unit IDs, and each endpoint receives a
  seam-clipped party gable whose ridge follows the source span. Both sockets must be opposite and terminate on distinct terrain-borne building lineages;
  perpendicular contacts and same-building returns are cantilevers, never skywalks. A bridge cannot
  survive as a floating roof, independent room, or post-hoc visual link. Two parallel public lanes use full end portals.
  A single public lane may instead carry a typed 1.5 m lateral half-bay: the public lane bears at
  both ends and the
  unused companion lane is reserved as air. That form does not draw a full doorway into the empty
  half-landing. No corbel is rendered under either end of any span (they read as hanging stair
  flights); `SKYWALK_BEARER_DROP` still reserves the same headroom beneath the deck; they
  may not spill sideways into an unrelated lower street. Each compact roof is rotated about its bay centre so its authored ridge follows the
  crossing and its bearing plane stays exactly on the wall tops; no detached entrance posts or magic
  roof offset remain. The floor, wall, and ceiling visuals opt out of their source assets' overbroad
  baked hulls and use exact worker-side box claims committed on the main thread instead. The
  side/ceiling boxes are inset at both landings, and enclosure admission checks lower public headroom
  under every occupied lane plus public surfaces throughout the complete two-band roof volume, so
  the real player capsule retains every open endpoint gate, lower lane, and stacked upper walk
  without making the walls nonphysical. Every walked lane has structural end surfaces with
  continuing support; the passage may be open below, but its occupied upper shell can never be
  detached from a terrain-reaching building/public-surface chain. An open timber link reserves the
  one band above its deck required by the player capsule; the optional enclosed shell separately
  reserves two complete bands over every shell lane. A separate public walk in either occupied head
  band rejects the structural span because its player lane has priority. The conservative surrounding
  shell must also remain free of solid/occluding mass. Failing the enclosure-only check changes the
  presentation to the open timber bridge when that bridge's own player headroom remains valid; it
  never weakens the structural clearance. A one-cell gap remains the smaller railed timber bridge
  because the authored house shell cannot fit it without narrowing the player lane.
  Separately, already-clad massif faces may receive non-occupying facade bays or half-cell bump-outs
  only after the exact lower-course, route-headroom, built-mass, and blocked-feature tests pass.
  Their combined deterministic rate is 67%, capped at one projection per facade column, and every
  accepted projection is gated on the two measured corbel stations as a clearance proof only --
  nothing is rendered beneath it; this visual channel never invents a room or
  support fact. Ordinary two-column room jetties use the same rule structurally: one invisible
  support course per bearing column, sealed with the corbel's declared envelope. A broad
  attachment bracket or loose horizontal plank is not an eligible shallow
  jetty support. Green massif tops and the planned village green are generated by
  `TerrainChunkMesher.flat_ground_surface` as one exact union of their logical cells, not by scaled
  or overlapping KayKit grass panels. The production adapter binds that union to the same
  `ground_palette.tres` UV/material and fills its vertices from the same world-space
  `BiomeRegistry.ground_tint_at` field as streamed terrain. Exposed rims use
  `CliffDressing.TERRAIN_SKIN_ASSETS` and `CliffDressing.tint_at`, so their wall/lip assets and biome
  colour follow the terrain authority too. Shared cell boundaries and a rim derived from the final
  union make grass gaps, duplicate coplanar panels, and misaligned lips impossible by construction.
  Retained source stone is finalized only after measured roofs and structural cells are accepted:
  exact roof-placement volumes are subtracted, then the completed fine-lattice solid union is
  flood-solved from the sampled terrain bearing. A face-disconnected source component is discarded
  before skinning even when its obsolete envelope happens to touch finished structure; the sealed
  room/foundation bearing DAG, not incidental source stone, is the authority for building support.
  Detached construction-envelope scaffolding can therefore never appear as a rock cube around a
  roof or silently carry a floating building. Transition-owned and buried raw faces are removed
  before adjacent stone cells are paired, then face pairs and their treatments are rebuilt from the
  final exposed set; suppressing one surface can therefore never leave its former partner missing.
  Masonry panels are inset by their
  measured half-depth so their visible outer faces share the timber facade's lattice plane, keeping
  the grass lip continuous through material transitions. Tall retained faces alternate complete
  authored facade and coursed-stone storeys from the top down, so no pair of white/timber courses
  can form one uninterrupted multi-storey wall. Both upright courses and horizontal retained caps
  inherit one blue/orange/amber district stone wash; the near-white facets of the authored rock
  atlas can therefore never reappear as detached polygon scraps where a wall turns into its cap.
  Retained faces are capped at two storeys in the
  production audit, while the outer parcel profile steps to one-storey pitched-roof houses before
  the central mass rises. One deterministic narrow building on the lowest occupied datum may retain
  its seeded tower height as a vertical accent, but it still commits as one complete floor-to-roof
  house plot through the ordinary carved-volume, street-stranding, and terrain-bearing gates. More
  generally, a storey may be a public walkway/undercroft or a building may cantilever across it only
  when the occupied mass above owns an explicit endpoint, stack, bracket, or foundation ancestry that
  reaches terrain; elevated circulation is encouraged, unsupported upper architecture is invalid.
  The source's plaza deck is also a typed plan fact, not whichever decorative lawn happens to be
  largest: reservation grows one complete aspect-bounded macro rectangle, the public surface solver
  proves its entries and support, and `SettlementFabricPlan.planned_plaza_cells` carries that exact
  reachable square into the terrain-parity turf and threshold pass. Because those turf cells remain
  sealed public floor, late centre features and boundary planting are ineligible there; unwalked
  roof greens may still receive measured furniture. Tiny 1x1 leftover caps never become public
  plazas. Optional facade, roof, and garden decor is accepted only when its measured authored
  AABB misses the exact player-width swept prism over every exterior walk surface; suppression may
  remove an optional prop but cannot move a route, wall, roof, or seed-specific coordinate.
  Exact third-storey court frontage freezes only the contacted facade columns, not an entire room;
  half-storey paired relief indexes every occupied fine-Y slice and may atomically repartition two
  neighboring rooms before either is rejected in isolation. Addressed replacement rooms use the
  same two measured door phases as ordinary construction, and a load-bearing room below that
  threshold may still reshape while preserving the exact support column. The global support
  allocator may join collinear measured cantilever courses into one explicit timber frame; the
  compiler records those structural joins as semantic visual seams, while every unrelated room,
  feature, and support overlap remains forbidden.
  Lived-in roof, market, balcony, and facade dressing draws from measured collisionless plants,
  benches, chairs, bags, buckets, crates, barrels, lanterns, and firewood. Those props participate
  with their full authored AABBs in the same construction transaction as the room or structural
  surface that bears them; they are not a post-pass scatter that may clip walls or circulation.
  The fast diagnostic
  `tests/harness/warren_spatial_review.tscn` renders the already-sealed fine-grid candidate directly
  and adds route-transition, authored-facing dormer, outcrop-oblique, and front/underside balcony
  falsification views. `tests/harness/dormer_recipe_review.gd` separately renders the exact compiled
  dormer recipes from catalog meshes to verify their roof intersection without town occlusion. It deliberately bypasses corpus
  selection and is not evidence that the production selector accepted a seed. Its
  `--production-terrain-site` mode instead runs the real selected settlement transaction, commits
  the exact production entry list (including terrain-derived support posts), renders surrounding
  `TerrainChunkMesher` chunks in the town's local frame, and omits the diagnostic road skin so paths
  remain the actual terrain or structural surfaces production owns. The spatial fabric
  compiler assigns every segmented building lineage one of three deterministic authored
  construction styles, independently of streaming. Each exact tower/slim/row/square/long footprint
  has a flush and rich recipe in that style with identical solids, inhabited volume, sockets, and
  entrances; storeys alternate only within the lineage's pair. Theme/form/style-selected ivy,
  clothes, signs, or planter-and-flower windowboxes form the measured rich phase, which retries its
  paired flush recipe when the projection conflicts with already accepted construction. Before that
  choice it derives a finite mandatory weather-closure domain from the sealed occupancy/roof faces:
  complete terminal plates reserve an exact tiled gable profile, private partial rows reserve their
  handed clipped-gable alternatives, and plank backing is eligible only when that row already owns
  a sealed public floor. The same closure groups are preserved against optional features before
  final face regions exist, then rechecked semantically and by measured AABB after each roof choice,
  so a facade, balcony, or earlier crown cannot consume every valid roof of a later house. A
  bay/laundry/sign phase may fall back, but cannot make the later roof pass impossible. Every pitched roof placement is aligned from its measured visual
  lower bound to the logical wall-top bearing plane; composite row/slim crowns may vary horizontally
  but may not raise one neighboring shell above another. `SettlementFabricPlan.add_unit()` also
  rejects every complete pitched roof whose measured visual XZ centre or wall-top bearing differs
  from its logical solid footprint, so an offset crown cannot enter the sealed transaction. It stages
  semantic occupancy and publishes
  it only after visual-envelope validation, so a rejected rich phase cannot leave ghost claims that
  poison that exact fallback transaction.
  Production then compiles the sealed spatial plan and rejects it unless inhabited/structural mass
  covers at least 38% of public route cells, all-height through-core sightlines are at most 48, and
  ground through-core sightlines are at most 20. These are screenshot-backed acceptance gates, not
  decorative scores: a feature-complete town with an open plaza or horizon-length street is not a
  production result. Diagnostic review disables no visual-overlap rule; every captured candidate
  must pass the same strict measured-envelope transaction as production.
  Skywalk reservations are solved against the fixed exact parcel partition and preserved through
  asset compilation; do not fake extra links when no independent measured corridor exists. Rules
  that read a plot-model fact are guarded by `mass_context.has(&"maze_source_plan")` so a
  hand-built fixture volume cannot trip them.
  `WarrenVolumeEnvelope` is the shared height/address envelope the sealed `WarrenVolumePlan`
  carries; `WarrenMazeVolumeAdapter` builds one for every town through
  `WarrenExcavationVolumeAdapter.envelope_from_massif`, and `VillageWarrenFabricSolver` samples
  real terrain against it. That plan distinguishes remaining building `MASS`, abstract `WALK`
  floor planes, swept `PUBLIC_AIR`, and deliberate `DAYLIGHT_VOID`. `WarrenVolumeTransition` owns both endpoints and complete swept air;
  every edge changes by at most one 1.5 m circulation band. Vertical edges always reserve a physical
  span between two square landings: a two-macro-cell edge owns a complete 3 m stair, while a
  three-or-more-cell edge owns at least 6 m and becomes a sloped walkway. Perpendicular vertical
  turns require square landings; adjacent full platform squares are never accepted as a zero-length
  stair. The parcel contract itself is unchanged by who produces it: only roofable 1x1,
  narrow/deep 1x2, and 2x2 macro footprints, never a frontage wider than its depth, and only
  complete 3 m inhabited storeys on arbitrary 1.5 m base phases. The parcel's real transformed
  authored door must land inside its addressed public square; a facade-wide proxy address is
  invalid.
  `WarrenVolumePublicRealmAdapter` expands the route losslessly into the common two-lane lattice.
  Its only added surfaces are small one/two-ring courts owned by existing elevated route nodes;
  optional one-cell galleries preferentially cross a lower public route or terminate in a pocket
  bounded by two inhabited facades. Both remain short route-fused strips with exact support,
  headroom, guard, and connectivity proofs; neither can become a detached suspended platform.
  Ground-street cells without inhabited or structural overhead are flood-audited as same-level
  components; no accepted component may exceed twelve 1.5 m cells. After hard raw-core closure,
  optional galleries are chosen by the reduction they make to the largest such component before
  aesthetic scores break ties. `WarrenPrunedMassPlan` owns whether provisional Gaussian mass is
  real structure: only `BUILDING` and `BEARING_OPPORTUNITY` block headroom. An `OUTSIDE_CORE` cell
  may support an upper-gallery extension only when that cell directly shelters an already sealed
  lower public route, so tapered-envelope air cannot act like an invisible ceiling or authorize
  arbitrary suspended terraces. `WarrenVolumeTransition.surface_cells()` is the shared exact
  two-lane stair/ramp footprint; platform discovery reserves that surface plus its full headroom
  before admitting any gallery.
  Lightwells are subtracted after the full union is known only when every cardinal side is public
  surface or inhabited wall and a flood proves every surviving extension cell still reaches its
  owning route square; an explicit unbounded hole is rejected. Raw
  parcel-stage openings are audited before infill and no cardinal component may exceed
  four macro columns; post-infill permits no unclassified 3 m core aperture at all. Only
  isolated, bounded, guarded 1.5 m lightwells may then be subtracted, with at least three
  fine cells between their XZ projections even across different levels. This prevents a broad
  failed cavity from being hidden beneath one low deck. Incidental court contact beside a
  transition is reduced to a deterministic non-overlapping seam subset rather than duplicating
  stair lanes.
  The compiler derives facade openings, guards, and collision-bearing ramp/stair meshes from
  those same facts; each vertical transition covers every logical stair cell, owns two side rails,
  and meets both landings across exact two-lane seams. Horizontal courts render reviewed fixed
  board assets while the generated union remains collision-only, avoiding the duplicate dark skin.
  The fine spatial plan additionally proves the source volume's exact route surface is a subset of
  the final connected route (late market aisles may only extend it), and the common spatial surface
  compiler must receive that immutable volume lineage so every logical vertical edge has matching
  render and collision geometry. The review harness includes low-landing transition captures; a
  connected graph without a visible/collidable climb is a failure.
  stair/ramp meshes use a stable plank shader. Sparse timber supports derive from exposed court
  cells down to an explicit datum, while a court only one half-level above terrain is enclosed by
  fixed retaining-wall modules instead of becoming a crawl-height undercroft. The production
  terrain adapter likewise derives posts from exposed public-surface boundary corners and repeats
  them at the authored 3 m structural rhythm; fully enclosed interior cells are omitted so a broad
  deck gains a legible perimeter load path without becoming a forest of posts.
  `WarrenSpatialFabricCompiler` compiles the measured terrain-rooted stacks, complete roofs,
  occupied skywalks, and roofed outcroppings through one common fabric/air/solid-void transaction;
  `WarrenAssetCompiler` survives as its vocabulary helper (facade-family selection, room and parcel
  socket endpoints, skywalk compatibility, the partition asset cache) after task F1 deleted its own
  `solve` entry along with the searched town it compiled. Visually one-storey proposals and every
  frontage-wider-than-depth orientation are ineligible. Equal-height, equal-family neighbours may
  meet only through an exact collinear-eave party-wall seam; unequal, gable, corner, and overlapping
  contacts remain conflicts. Occupied straight skywalks use a measured pitched repeat-and-gable
  roof run; a floor module is never reused as their ceiling. Complete stocked-market candidates
  prefer residual open-core columns before their stable hashed tie-break. Exact frontage, overhead,
  occupied-link, and sightline audits own the final no-through-street decision -- as GUIDANCE
  carried in the audit, not as gates: there is one candidate, so a metric a town misses is a
  recorded fact rather than a rejection. The composed-enclosure viability floor, the ranked
  eight-plan frontier and its rescue-plan tier were properties of the searched frontier and died
  with it in task F1, together with the terrain-level arcade branch grammar
  (`WarrenGroundArcadeSolver`) that ran before parcel packing.
  HISTORICAL, and kept only because the invariants it names are still enforced: the four-seed
  measured gate and the 44-image cleanup review above were measured on the SEARCHED pipeline that
  task F1 deleted, so their per-seed counts describe towns nothing builds any more. The structural
  facts they pinned do survive as gates in the compiler and the plan seals -- distinct
  maze/construction signatures, connected roofed buildings, zero visually short parcels, no stair
  endpoint gap, isolated guarded lightwells, no unclassified 3 m core aperture, a bounded largest
  uncovered lower-route component, and zero public-air/occupied or visual-envelope overlap -- and
  the falsification findings behind them still hold: four lightwells could leave one broad opaque
  upper court where six bounded fine-cell wells break that surface without reopening a
  top-to-ground shaft, and cardinally bounded subtraction could still sever a one-cell route neck
  until route-connectivity validation was added. The CURRENT corpus measurement is the sweep's:
  24 of 24 towns seal, and the four planner seeds (12/4 compact, 3/9 standard) are solved
  end to end by `tests/test_warren_maze_composition.gd`. Visual review is Phase G's battery.
  `VillageWarrenFabricSolver` aligns the selected volumetric landing to the production road,
  resamples immutable terrain bands, and materializes that sealed fabric through `VillagePlan`.
  The route node is where the arriving road ends, so the entry's terrain contact -- the foot of the
  handoff ramp plus the road's half width -- is anchored on that node: a gate that faces the road
  meets it head-on, and a gate the terrain forced sideways meets it as a right-angled T instead of
  swallowing the road's last metres under its edge houses. Every quarter is also tried with the
  older entry-cell anchoring, ordered after the contact-anchored frames of the same alignment, so a
  seed whose secondary gate loses its projection at the shifted frame still builds. Each gate
  handoff quad chooses its winding per contact (the lateral tangent is a cell-order convention, not
  a handedness), so no ramp is back-face culled from above.
  Missing common fabric vocabulary is a construction error, never a request to invoke an older
  terrain-led fallback.
  Village contracts live under `features/villages/`: `VillageProgram` caps anchors at
  144 m and records at the settlement's 192 m inset; `VillageFrame` freezes the accepted route
  signature; `VillageRecord` seals sorted semantic output; `VillageOccupancy` is a bucketed typed
  3D index (`SOLID`, `WALK_SURFACE`, `HEADROOM`, `GROUND_EXCLUSIVE`, `WALK_GUARD`). Public
  `WALK_GUARD` rails may meet only walk surfaces or sibling guards in their explicitly declared
  walk network; generic solids never inherit that seam permission. `FoundationSolver` proves
  enterable floors above natural terrain and tiles fixed perimeter modules; `SupportSolver`
  composes fixed-height stacks with bounded burial and atomic occupancy. `VillagePlan` solves one
  atomic `VillageUrbanFabricPlan`; its furnishing belongs to that same transaction and there is no
  legacy post-pass for standalone props. A rejected urban solve emits no village payload, so a tent or campfire can never
  masquerade as a settlement. `VillageRecord.urban_fabric` is the canonical typed structural
  record; the older fixed `VillageElevatedDistrict` and its isolated regression test have been
  removed. Production rolls only
  village/town; the compiled hamlet vocabulary stays dormant until it can satisfy the same
  inhabited multi-level contract.
  `VillageOutskirtsSolver` runs only after an accepted urban transaction. Every painted outskirts
  lane, including the final spur to a prefab doorstep, is the ordinary `PathProgram.PATH_WIDTH`;
  only the spur's reserved headroom narrows to the measured doorway. The edge district is meant to
  RING the dense core (2026-09-04): each exit's neighbourhood reaches sixteen grid steps so the
  flanking runs of two or three gates wrap most of a silhouette, six roots per side are ranked,
  and `VillageOutskirtsProgram.target_houses` asks for 6/9 houses or three per sealed exit. The
  town's terrain-qualified perimeter stalls are published on `VillageUrbanFabricPlan.frontage_sites`;
  the perimeter grid blocks them like mass so the lane runs in FRONT of the stalls, and a root
  facing a stall row is a MARKET lot: its house stands one `MARKET_STALL_BAND` (three cells) back
  from the lane's outer edge, and every town stall fronting that lane gets a TWIN of the same
  reviewed asset directly across it (slid sideways past the door spur when the house is centred
  on it), standing as close to the lane as the lane clearance allows and under the prefab's
  eave, its occupancy clipped at the headroom line exactly as the house's own eave is; each twin
  is proved on level dry ground and against district occupancy, keyed by the town stall it
  mirrors so two market lots cannot double it. The street then has market fronts on both sides
  and a building behind. For production volumetric
  warrens every sealed terrain exit seeds one bounded entrance-neighbourhood street graph. The
  solver rasterizes the exact union of `SOLID`, `WALK_SURFACE`, and `WALK_GUARD` volumes on the
  shared 3 m world/village lattice. Lots stay on its nearby one-cell exterior contour, from
  one through sixteen grid steps from their nearest exit; street routing may use the bounded
  three-cell exterior band to avoid copying every facade notch. Direction-aware search minimizes
  turns first and length second. Each demanded route roots back to the primary road contact,
  rather than ending in an isolated secondary-exit fragment. It never draws a belt road around the bounding
  box or offers parcels no exit neighbourhood reaches. A local street occupies the single grid cell between the urban fabric
  and the prefab frontage; district/ecology clearances and the union's bounding rectangle cannot
  create a vacant moat. Candidate perches are qualified inside that bounded corridor *before*
  terrain ranking is capped, and alternate roots remain at least one compact-house frontage apart.
  The corridor derives each candidate centre from the exact oriented support radius, so even- and
  odd-cell footprints both put their wall immediately beyond the lane without a later offset. A
  broad prefab's authored off-centre door projects onto that same continuous contour lane, but its
  bearing remains cardinal and its measured support footprint must remain immediately outside the
  lane. The complete house is transformed in the same uniform 2x authored-to-world frame as the
  dense warren; visual meshes, attachments, collision, support, doorway, and occupancy all share
  that transform. The full upper/eave envelope is still reserved above public headroom, while
  ground-route collision uses the borne support footprint below headroom and the broader visual
  envelope above it, so an eave cannot masquerade as a wall. Its door
  faces a short connected doorstep spur; its reservation may taper to the authored threshold,
  while all painted paths retain the normal 4 m width. Complete polylines remove collinear
  segmentation and use `PathProgram.filleted_path_shapes`: the normal road's 4 m centreline
  radius (limited by short runs), with 32 capsule chords per quarter turn. Both producers paint
  through the same terrain path/spot surface, not a second road material or overlay. Finished
  curved paint is checked against ground-level solids, without rejecting valid overhead roofs.
  One exit may serve multiple nearby houses, but
  every sealed exit must retain a proved neighbourhood connection. The production entry comes from
  the sealed source volume's exact world transform; local frontage selection remains separate from
  its connection to the shared primary-root street tree. Repeated reservation edges deduplicate
  by stable identity, and coincident paint is a field union rather than overlapping mesh sheets on shared
  paths. Houses are complete enterable authored assets placed once at ground level, with attachments, a measured
  perimeter foundation, a proved public lane, and the same typed occupancy transaction as the
  dense core; tents and detached prop shelters are ineligible. Failure remains optional and leaves
  no partial edge payload. This makes the settlement taper into an immediate inhabited ground-level
  entrance district without growing a disconnected radial camp or a gratuitous full-town ring.
  `VillageTerrainView` is the only cross-block terrain/water query adapter;
  `VillageTerrainSurvey` discovers and spatially buckets guarded-source-dry buildable perches
  without mutating the heightfield (exact water remains a final-transaction check); and
  `VillageMassingSolver` uses a bounded, composition-diverse beam plus a ranked complete-plan
  frontier to pack 7–15 inhabited buildings into a 42 m core (10/15 authored targets for
  village/town). It tries comparable ranks
  across building counts instead of exhausting near-duplicate dense failures first. The massing
  contract requires at least three irregular elevation bands, short neighbours, and real
  half-rises while preferring direct terrain contact over bounded retaining-terrace variants.
  `VillageVerticalProfile` derives its 12 m full / 6 m half-level cadence from the tallest
  stackable furnished house plus roof clearance; terrain storeys remain an unrelated landform
  unit. The route landing and already-solved ground market are hard reservations, each accepted
  footprint expands into both legitimate facade directions, and reviewed door/stair access is
  qualified before beam search. Larger furnished houses are ground-only accents, so adding asset
  variety cannot silently increase the vertical cadence or erase the compact-house vocabulary.
  `VillageMarketSolver` runs first and selects one connected orthogonal alley topology before any
  building is admitted; reviewed stalls line both sides where terrain and exact 3D occupancy
  permit. The market's street/headroom volumes participate in the same massing transaction rather
  than being optional decoration added after the town exists.
  `VillageCirculationSolver` owns topology only. It first builds all cheap direct right-angle
  terrain edges, then asks `VillageGroundRouter` for bounded A* detours solely between remaining
  disconnected components. Ground routes may cross natural height bands only through frozen
  fixed-module `VillageStairTransition`s. `VillageRouteStairFabricSolver` materializes each flight
  on the exact requesting terrain edge, keeps the worn street continuous beneath it, derives two
  slope-aligned collision-bearing side rails per stair module, and treats intersecting ground
  flights as one public-circulation compound. `VillageAerialRouter` derives a
  bounded acyclic set of short rounded links and one-module-deep public forecourts that exist only
  at inhabited facade seams. There is no long-span or empty suspended-platform fallback.
  `VillageRouteGeometry` owns the shared swept-headroom facts. The graph must connect every door to
  the route landing, contain a useful ground-street fabric, at least two local aerial links, and at
  least one inhabited shared platform; aerial links remain at most 24 m.
  The support compiler freezes each massed floor and chooses one typed atomic mode from terrain
  opportunity: naturally supported perches receive the ordinary fixed perimeter foundation,
  while retained perches receive the compact rock core. Exact 1.5 m timber cells
  exist only outside that core under the unsupported part of the building (plus one skirt-apron
  row), or on a thin route; a whole tile is removed when its OBB overlaps any core. There are no
  substantial uninhabited suspended platforms. Exposed timber edges derive exact compound
  railings, with graph openings at doors and stairs. Sparse fixed timber support stacks sample
  exposed boundary corners at roughly one stack per three modules and never use non-uniform scale;
  individual candidates are
  omitted if they hit a core, stair, water, unsupported ground span, terrain above the deck, or a
  lower walk surface. Required rock stacks reference the lowest ground under their broad stencil,
  may bury by less than two storeys on the high side, and use at most eight fixed modules, so they
  seal natural slopes without stretching or floating. Rock cores, buildings, skirts, routes,
  stairs, railings, and protected undercroft headroom beneath the lowest viable inhabited overhang
  all validate before the district materializes. Bound ground activity is optional and cannot
  veto a complete inhabited district; any required-structure failure omits the whole transaction.
  `VillageOutskirtsSolver` may then place sparse houses immediately outside the exact occupied-volume
  contour. Every sealed terrain exit feeds its bounded local entrance-neighbourhood street graph;
  no street is extended around unrelated sides of the settlement. Each complete prefab sits one
  shared 3 m lane outside the core, remains aligned to the town lattice, faces its doorstep connection, and is shown in
  corpus review together with the dense city rather than as an isolated facade. Sparse ground houses never
  substitute for the required dense urban transaction. Production outskirts use complete
  enterable furnished houses across blue/orange runtime variants, including the larger SFV homes
  that remain awkward inside the sectional grammar. Selection is a bounded measured construction
  search: each lot tries the upper support-area cohort first, then independently surveys progressively
  smaller complete prefabs only when the exact terrain contour, doorway, or neighboring mass cannot
  carry a larger candidate. Tents and closed-front shelters remain catalogued but are excluded from
  this inhabited taper. Freestanding tables are never facade-gap filler; table dressing appears only
  inside a complete reviewed market envelope whose support and clearance were admitted together.
- **`field/WorldFieldBlockCache.gd`** — the worker-confined canonical owner of independently lazy
  terrain regions and exact water contexts. Half-open 192 m keys and deterministic bounded LRU
  make planning, meshing, water, and dressing share the same live field objects without locks or
  output dependence on query order. `TerrainSurfaceField.is_walkable_edge` is likewise the one
  symmetric exposed-boundary fact shared by path traversal and the rendered mesh.
- **Environment assets** (`scripts/terrain/environment/`, `terrain/environment/`) — source-pack
  scenes are editor-baked into lightweight descriptors plus self-contained meshes, materials,
  textures, typed visual pieces, and optional typed collision pieces. Manifest scale is applied
  exactly once at bake time: KayKit retains its legacy wrapper scales and LPFV nature uses a 3.25×
  pack correction. Reviewed KayKit primitives are preserved from bake-only collision templates
  where they fit: the owner's original three-cylinder proxy remains on KayKit rock 1, while
  rock 2's oversized sphere is replaced by a mesh-derived flat-topped hull. KayKit trees 2 and 4
  are intentionally absent from the catalogue.
  LPFV rigid assets normally use one snag-free primitive per disconnected hard component. Trees use
  a rotated capsule around only the grounded lower trunk, fitted from true mesh cross-sections so
  sparse/leaning low-poly vertices cannot pull it off-centre. The strongly curved LPFV tree 2 uses
  an explicit four-capsule chain instead: short capsules follow successive cross-sections and
  adjacent capsule axis endpoints are the exact same point, making their hemispherical caps
  concentric at each rounded joint; one global chord can no longer protrude from the bend. Logs use
  flat-ended rotated cylinders, the
  fallen branch uses a rotated capsule, stumps use flat-topped cylinders, and rocks use an inset
  box or a convex hull whose top is flattened into a face. Multi-rock source clusters declare their
  hard-component count in the manifest, so each visible stone receives its own disjoint hull rather
  than one collider bridging the empty space between them. Decorative foliage and mushrooms never
  enlarge physics. This deliberately avoids overlapping compound-shape lips, point-topped walkable
  objects, and collision that bridges empty space. Low rocks tagged `walkover` cap their collision
  height so their largest authored dressing scale remains below the character's step height; a
  catalogue test couples those values and prevents later tuning from breaking traversal. Assets
  tagged `tree`, `rock`, or `deadwood` are rejected by
  the bake unless they declare collision, so rigid dressing cannot silently become non-blocking.
  Runtime consumers use
  stable asset IDs through the
  lightweight `EnvironmentCatalog`; the main-thread `EnvironmentRenderCache` selectively loads
  only active visuals. `EnvironmentInstancePayload` may mask collision on an individual visual
  placement and carry resource-free box transforms/sizes when a generated construction has a
  tighter reviewed traversal contract than the reusable asset's baked hull; only
  `EnvironmentCollisionBuilder` and `FeatureCommitQueue` create those `BoxShape3D` resources on
  the main thread. Both adapters must honor the per-placement collision mask; visual-only bridge
  shells may never silently regain their broad baked hulls while crossing the village record.
  Environment runtime resources never depend on the source packs under
  `assets/`. `tools/environment_bake/` is the only owner of those source paths. Generated palette
  variants may selectively recolour foliage texels. The dense-grass bake may select an authored
  subtree and merge/simplify either separate or indexed-component ribbon leaves, optionally
  spreading whole components radially and retaining per-component root XZ in UV2 for local
  deformation; the current
  collision-free Collection 5 patch is about 1.10–1.27 m tall after authored variation and does
  not participate in ordinary dressing. The
  Fantasy Village man-made feature pack uses
  a reviewed 2× human-scale bake correction for its freestanding arches and lamp. A manifest
  fallback supplies the orange atlas missing from the second large arch's source material, so the
  correction is baked into the self-contained runtime asset. Its bridge
  retains the independently calibrated `[1.2, 1.0, 6.0]` vector scale that supplies a human-scale
  deck and rails plus the required crossing span. Large arches use compound collision following
  four posts, upper beams, diagonal braces, and both roof slopes; the character-height opening
  stays clear while collision reaches the visual top and depth.
  The reviewed village-structure bake likewise treats collision as structural geometry, never a
  prefab-wide box. The campfire/spit uses six cylinders (ring, crossbar, and four stands); the
  walk-in tent uses one two-sided triangular roof shell, four rectangular posts, a rectangular ridge, and a
  triangular back prism; stalls use four posts plus three canopy panels; stocked tables use a top
  and four legs; the well uses eight disjoint ring segments, two posts, and two roof slopes; fence,
  railing, and quest-board assets preserve their separate rails/posts/boards. Catalog tests pin
  these primitive mixes and piece counts. `environment_lineup.tscn -- --asset ID
  --show-collision --collision-closeup` is the required visual check; add
  `--depth-test-collision` to expose only proxy material outside the rendered mesh.
  Every active material still multiplies
  the independent per-instance biome tint. `terrain/materials/forest.tres` is a self-contained
  bake-compatibility path for Godot's imported KayKit scene UID, not a runtime material owner.
- **`field/FieldTerrainStreamer.gd`** — the only scene-tree node (`Node3D` in `world.tscn`,
  wired to the player). Builds field chunks within `CHUNK_RADIUS` of the player on **one
  background worker thread**. It compiles dressing, grass, and the composed `FeatureProgram`,
  then warms terrain, nature, and grass resources on the main thread before starting the worker.
  Man-made feature assets are deliberately excluded from eager warm-up and demand-loaded by the
  commit queue.
  The worker returns only arrays/transforms/sampler payloads. Terrain and feature generations are
  independent, but queued requests for one block widen into one job. Typed grass jobs reuse the
  canonical `WorldFieldBlockCache`/`WorldFeaturePlan`, are eligible only after their containing terrain is
  committed, and sit behind player-critical and grass-underlay terrain but ahead of the outer
  terrain ring. Grass never gates terrain readiness. A completed terrain payload waits in one nearest-first
  list until every key in its footprint-derived feature halo is ready; v1's maximum footprint
  yields exactly the lexicographically sorted 3×3 square. Empty feature blocks are explicit ready
  records and allocate no node/resource. `FeatureCommitQueue` demand-loads sorted assets and
  incrementally creates collision under count + elapsed-time budgets; only a collision-complete
  block attaches under `ManmadeFeatures` and becomes ready, while visuals remain independently
  budgeted. Terrain then
  commits in terrain → water → dressing collision → `add_child` → FX → dressing visual order,
  `MAX_BUILD_PER_FRAME` per frame, nearest-first, evicting beyond
  `KEEP_RADIUS` (features use `KEEP_RADIUS + feature_halo`). The worker exclusively owns its
  `_settlements`/`_features`/`_water`/field/mesher instances, so their
  caches need no locks. `FieldTerrainStreamer` also remains the only owner allowed to attach the
  grass and trample roots to the scene tree; grass runtime is skipped in headless terrain runs.
  Each sealed village's complete instance/collision payload belongs to the feature block that
  contains its canonical centre. Its ground and clearance shapes remain query-projected. Because
  the compiled record reach is less than one block, the existing one-block feature halo keeps that
  owner resident anywhere the village can intersect terrain while avoiding duplicate per-asset
  MultiMesh and physics batches across several blocks.
  At startup the player is frozen until every chunk within one logical terrain cell of spawn
  and its feature square is ready. The production spawn is inset 0.5 m into chunk `(0, 0)` so its
  capsule has one collision owner, but the camera-visible startup boundary still covers all four
  origin quadrants; later, a missing current
  chunk freezes them during teleports or when outrunning the worker. Collision therefore cannot
  pop in after movement starts. Ordinary radius terrain is not queued until this startup set and
  its feature dependencies finish, preventing unrelated mesh work from extending the loading
  screen; the cold river/path spike stays off the main thread. Owns the
  `world_seed` (random per run). `TerrainWorldTuning` is the single owner of
  `HEIGHTFIELD_AMPLITUDE`, `HEIGHTFIELD_MAX_STOREYS`, and `MAX_CLIFF_STEP`; the streamer has no
  inert inspector mirrors whose values look editable but are ignored.

## Shared fields & utilities (`scripts/core/`)

- **`TraversalEnvelope.gd`** — resource-free canonical player capsule, aperture, headroom, and
  finished/planning step limits. Village solvers consume it and a scene contract test pins it to
  the live character collision and controller constants.

- **`Helper.gd`** — deterministic, infinite-terrain-safe noise fields, all pure functions of
  `(pos, world_seed)`: `macro_density01`, biome fields `biome_forest01` / `biome_rocky01` /
  `biome_foliage_density` / `biome_weights5`, value-noise
  (`_value_noise01`), and hashing helpers (`_cell_hash01`, splitmix64 `_mix64`). Also
  transform/AABB/collision helpers. `HeightfieldPlan._height01` samples these for landform shape.
  (Some doc comments here still name the retired `TerrainGenerator` — ignore those references.)
- **`Distribution.gd` / `PriorityQueue.gd`** — small generic helpers.

## Terrain tools & water

- **`terrain/tools/CoordOverlay.gd`** — the F3 debug HUD (in `world.tscn`): a crosshair plus a
  readout of the seed, the player's cell, the crosshair-target cell, and the 3×3 storey grid
  around it. A screenshot alone then pins down exactly where a terrain issue is — use it to
  reproduce a reported bug by its seed and coordinates. Storeys come from immutable snapshots
  attached to committed chunks; the main-thread HUD never reads the worker-owned plan or caches.
- **`terrain/tools/SlopeProfile.gd` / `SlopeAtlas.gd`** — the `smootherstep` slope profile math
  and grass/rock UV sampling from KayKit pieces, shared by the field and mesher.
- **Water** (`scripts/terrain/water/`): a deterministic **river network carved into the
  heightfield** — `WaterPlan` surveys four stratified candidates per 768 m district,
  climbs the highest to a prominent summit, and uses an 85% source roll. Its bounded
  2D contour walk prefers modest descent, keeps a winding handedness and clearance from
  old reaches, and drifts outward so it cannot close a loop around itself. Natural terrain
  can rise along a proposed open cutting, but the bank-contained hydraulic bed never rises.
  Raw routes allow 4.32 km of arc inside a 2.4 km displacement bound; basin termination
  starts at 2.64 km. The finite discovery halo includes summit ascent and the lake bound.
  Junction resolution selects a prefix of the cached raw route, never retraces the mountain.
  Odd-depth dependency prefixes remain contained in the realized depth-two network, so a
  tributary cannot join a part of another river that subsequently disappears.
  Raw bounds reject distant sources before expanding junction dependencies; neighbour queries
  use an immutable spatial index with canonical precedence. Terminal `PondStamp` bowls vary
  in size, axis and elongation within the same conservative radius bound. Carve applies
  inside `HeightfieldPlan.raw_height`. The 20–26 m channel half-width exceeds half a terrain
  cell's diagonal: diagonal centreline crossings fully excavate both intermediate cells,
  preserving a finite cardinal passage rather than corner-only contact. Channel carving
  projects each terrain sample onto the same
  variable-width trace **segment capsule** used by `WaterField` (not isolated trace-point
  discs), so bathymetry cannot leave uncarved 12m gaps beneath continuous rendered water.
  `WaterPlan.planning_signed_distance` / `planning_intervals` expose that same source geometry
  with one fixed guard for cheap route planning; they never build hydrostatic water.
  `WaterFieldContext.wet_intervals` is the exact, lazily contour-cached counterpart for final
  route and bridge validation, so feature consumers never reproduce water geometry.
  Beds obey **containment** (`CONTAIN_DROP`): every bed is
  capped a full storey below the lowest flanking bank's natural storey, so channels always
  quantize bounded by ground on both sides — never a sheet hanging off a hillside. The
  hydraulic trace bed and rendered bathymetry are intentionally separate: ordinary reaches
  excavate another `CARVE_BED_EXTRA` below the trace bed so 4m storey quantization cannot
  leave only centimetres of cover, while reaches whose trace-bed grade is already a fall face
  keep the original shallow carve (never turn a vertical film into a deep swim volume).
  Pure data flows `WaterField → WaterContour → WaterSkin`, turned into nodes by
  `WaterSurfaceBuilder`; one shader renders it all:
  - `WaterField` — profile and canonical-region caches identify both the immutable trace
    and its terrain-plan owner, preventing different worlds or junction prefixes with the
    same source cell from sharing stale levels. The continuous water surface is ONE height field `level_at(x,z)`, with
    **no cuts anywhere**: `profile()` is a single monotone, continuous curve per river.
    Ordinary reaches ride a smooth trend between anchors or hug a nearby steep face
    (unchanged in spirit); but a genuine multi-segment descent — several storeys down a
    real slope — is instead reshaped as ONE smooth **sill-riding envelope**: monotone C1
    cubic-Hermite, knots at the two span anchors plus any sill the naive curve would
    otherwise duck under, fit THROUGH the knots rather than clamped-then-corrected — so the
    water rides OVER intervening terrain instead of staircasing down it (the owner's
    round-4 reversal of run-2's terrain-hugging descent). Every floor-pinned point sits at
    `ground + DESCENT_CLAMP` (0.10m), a UNIFORM floor that must strictly clear the
    hydrostatic fill's own wetness epsilon `EPS` (0.05m) — at `DESCENT_CLAMP == EPS` the
    fill dries the exact band the envelope shaped to keep wet (r3 Task 12b). `steep_spans()`
    separately reports where the RENDERED terrain (not the level curve) drops more than
    `FALL_DROP_MIN` == 4m inside a 24m sliding window — purely a shader/mesh attribute bake,
    never geometry-forking. Static wetness beyond the channel/pond seeds themselves comes
    from a **hydrostatic fill**: river seeds are variable-width **segment capsules** whose
    levels interpolate at each lattice point's own longitudinal projection (not overlapping
    constant-level sample discs, which rebuilt terraces after the smooth profile); those
    flowing-channel lattice values are authoritative against a lower downstream flood. Seeds
    placed in channels and ponds spread outward only
    DOWNHILL-OR-LEVEL over connected ground sitting below the seed's own level (never
    uphill), with the LOWER level winning wherever two spreads meet. Those flood labels decide
    the deterministic **wet mask**, not the final flowing surface: five fixed Jacobi passes,
    anchored by the continuous river profile, relax the wet labels across river/pond joins so a
    lower flood cannot leave a one-cell sideways water cliff. Complete source extents are solved before the labels are projected into
    each 42m chunk margin; the five local passes then have a 30m radius. The canonical surface stays
    on a 6m world-space lattice; mixed coarse cells seed a sparse, topology-only 3m rescue where
    real terrain exposes a submerged passage between dry 6m endpoints. The rescue walks only
    downhill-or-level through points the coarse continuous field calls dry, lower level still wins,
    and untouched samples remain bit-identical to the 6m field. Across a mixed wet/dry lattice
    cell the field interpolates **signed depth**: dry corners contribute a small negative
    depth, capped so a high bank never pulls the surface uphill. Water therefore thins to
    zero depth on a contour inside the cell instead of ending as a square fill-grid edge —
    the field source of the rounded/blob-like shoreline. Pure and deterministic — no
    rendering, no nodes.
  - `WaterContour` — waterline → smooth, chunk-welded G1 polylines. Six-step pipeline:
    presence grid → per-edge crossing refinement → chain into polylines → two Chaikin
    passes + uniform 1.5m resample → clip to rect LAST → per-point level/normal/wall
    attributes from the curve's own frame. One dry-side orientation is chosen for the whole
    G1 curve, so a zero-gradient saddle cannot reverse adjacent outward normals and fold the
    rim into a bow tie. Wall detection probes that outward normal plus ±45° corner guards, so
    a tangent that bisects two cliff faces cannot look through their diagonal notch and
    misclassify the corner as a gentle blob shore; a 1–3-sample gap bracketed
    by real walls is closed only when their normals form a turn. Clipping LAST (after smoothing) is what makes
    the chunk weld: two neighbouring chunks both smooth the SAME margin-grown polyline
    before either clips it, so they land on bit-identical border-crossing points. SADDLE
    cells (marching-squares' standard ambiguous case: two diagonally-opposite corners wet)
    are resolved by sampling the field at the cell's own CENTRE (world-grid-aligned, so
    neighbouring chunks agree) rather than falling through a generic two-crossing path that
    used to silently drop the diagonal wedge (r3 Task 15). CLOSED curves resample by EVEN
    DIVISION of the circumference (`cnt = round(circ/spacing)` equal arcs, no remainder)
    instead of a fixed-spacing walk that left an arbitrary leftover segment.
  - `WaterCurrentField` — pure deterministic horizontal current constraints. `WaterSkin`
    seeds a world-aligned 3m lattice from downstream trace tangents; width/depth provide a
    readable base current even on flat reaches (about 2.3m/s at the pinned representative
    reach, clamped 1.4–6.5m/s) and grade only adds speed. A finite two-cell
    signed-distance bank field zeros dry samples and removes bank-entering velocity, then
    finite differences derive vorticity and compression for turning packets and generated
    foam. Production chunks solve with a two-cell halo, so adjacent chunks bake bit-identical
    retained border values. The velocity/diagnostics live in mesh `CUSTOM1` and the frozen
    `WaterSampler`; GPU and CPU consumers never reconstruct separate flow fields.
  - `WaterForces` — pure, scene-free force laws shared by water consumers: displaced-column
    buoyancy, horizontal drag toward `WaterSampler.velocity_at()`, and vertical water drag.
    Bodies keep their own volume-to-mass/drag tuning and integration adapter; never copy a
    separate approximation of the current or character-only buoyancy math into future props.
  - `WaterSkin` — the ONE mesh builder (the old marching-squares mesher is retired, r3 Task
    7; its own boundary was raw ~45-90° grid corners). Welds a 2m world-aligned render
    lattice to a boundary strip that sits directly ON `WaterContour`'s curves (zip-stitched
    via nearest-curve ring ownership — narrow-channel safe), plus a **meniscus rim** that
    curls the strip's own outer edge. Rising banks receive a compact overshoot; a wall-flagged
    point reaches the KayKit wall's true 1.5m recess (`TILE/2 - CliffDressing.PLACE`) only when
    its own outward column confirms high ground there. A short sustained-high witness handles
    diagonal cliff arms that leave the normal column before the long probe. Because contour
    smoothing can move the visual curve inside the final signed-depth wet region, every column
    first stays level through its initial continuous wet run; this closes inner-corner and saddle
    gaps without bridging a dry cliff arm to water on its far side. A confirmed wall column then
    measures any remaining contact distance,
    then stays at water level through the 1.5m recess and another 0.3m behind the visible face before
    curling down. Adjacent confirmed columns whose wall normals turn use the intersection of their
    wall tangents as a bounded miter, so their outer edge follows the actual L-shaped cliff corner
    instead of cutting it off with a diagonal chord. The visible surface therefore meets rounded
    cliff corners flat instead of using the lower curl to fill them. That direct-contact
    gate stops a flanking wall from stretching a genuinely unbounded edge into a skirt. Free/drop
    edges instead form a finite convex lobe: a +4cm crest followed by -6/-28/-55/-65cm rows over
    only 0.64m, with monotonically outward/downward-turning tangents. Every
    free edge is accounted for (a chunk border, a bank-buried outer row, or that compact lobe),
    so no zero-thickness plane ends sharply in open air. The first rim row also advances
    outward (no vertical repair-skirt seam). Open contours may border several disconnected
    interior-lattice rings where a narrow channel falls below the render grid; the boundary zipper
    splits those into local components and partitions the contour among them instead of joining
    them with non-local fan triangles. Remaining over-scale faces are adaptively subdivided, and
    only tiny local closed surface holes are triangulated. Level shelves also use level normals, including still-wet columns between diagonal banks;
    a free-edge curl normal on such a shelf creates a false reflective crease.
    Per-vertex CUSTOM0 bakes `(s, d,
    slope, shore_dist)` — arc length / signed cross-channel distance / continuous profile
    slope along the nearest river trace, plus shore distance. `CUSTOM1` bakes `(velocity.x,
    velocity.z, vorticity, compression)` from the shared `WaterCurrentField`. Vertex normals are real
    (heightfield-derived interior, rim-curl frame on the meniscus), not a blanket up vector.
    `ARRAY_COLOR.r` bakes a displacement scale from BOTH shore distance and actual static
    bed clearance; it covers the ambient spectrum plus packet-field trough bound. The shader,
    `WaterSampler.wave_scale_at()`, and character buoyancy use the same scale, so dynamic
    geometry cannot uncover a shallow bed while the CPU float height claims otherwise.
    `WaterSkin.build()` also returns `triggers`: one box per 24m wet tile, footprint from
    the mesh's own built vertices. r3 Task 12b RETIRED the whole-tile/sub-tile level-SPREAD
    suppression Tasks 7/9 had layered on top (`_tile_level_spread`,
    `TRIGGER_LEVEL_SPREAD_MAX`, `TRIGGER_SUB_TILE_SPREAD_MAX`) once the phantom-depth class
    it guarded against was proven dead by construction under the smooth descent envelope —
    triggers are simple wet-tile coverage again. `STEEP_UNSWIMMABLE` stays: a tile whose own
    max grade exceeds it gets **no trigger at all** — a steep fall face is not swimmable
    water, so a character falls/slides through it rather than floats. A single frozen
    `WaterSampler` snapshot of the water FIELD across the chunk (full wet footprint,
    shoreline band included; NaN only where the field itself says dry) backs every trigger
    for swim-depth queries.
  `WaterSurfaceBuilder` is a thin adapter: worker-safe `compute_chunk` calls `WaterSkin.build`;
  main-thread `commit_chunk` calls `WaterSkin.commit` and emits one `Area3D` swim trigger per
  `triggers` entry (never more than one per tile —
  the steep gate above means a tile either has one trigger or none), each carrying
  `set_meta("sampler", sampler)` so a probe anywhere inside reads its exact water height
  from that one shared, chunk-frozen sampler instead of a per-cell plane. The sampler freezes
  the field's native 6m fill lattice, sparse 3m topology rescue, and required terrain-height twins,
  then applies the identical dual-resolution signed-depth shoreline evaluation; do not resample
  levels through the render mesh grid, which
  double-interpolates steep shorelines and can turn dry/wade probes into false swimming. It also still owns
  the shared `ShaderMaterial` and the river-trace `surface_profile`/`steepness_profile`
  helpers.
  `water_unified.gdshader` is the ONLY water shader and renders the whole continuous network;
  no river/pond material fork or separate swept waterfall mesh exists. Its one
  `water_dynamic_height()` combines the slow ambient spectrum, persistent compact asymmetric
  wavelets, and interactive ripple height. Both vertex and fragment stages sample that SAME
  height: it displaces the 2m mesh and derives normals, refraction, curvature caustics, and
  reflection tilt, so a moving feature cannot become a detached albedo scroll. The old
  repeated river trains and fragment-only `water_distort_wobble` are deleted. Water is
  spectrally manual-composited: Beer–Lambert transmission
  (`absorption=(0.003,0.001,0.0005)`) stays in `EMISSION` because the refracted scene is
  already lit, while the real displaced normal uses Godot's PBR specular response. That split
  keeps the bottom dominant without losing the old clear swim-ripple highlight. Weak depth
  scattering and a broad Fresnel sky sheen supply the remaining body read. A short screen-space reflection
  ray march was actively rejected in the exact review view because its finite hit iterations
  formed concentric far-bank bands. White is legal only from generated energy:
  packet breaking or local flow compression. Swim/entry/ambient ripple impulses stay clear;
  their narrow height gradients refract and reflect the sky, and there is no foam/streak texture.
  `WaterRippleSim` owns two player-centred GPU fields. Its ping-pong wave equation carries
  swim wakes, entry splashes, and ambient clear rings; semi-Lagrangian backtracing advects it
  through a 32×32 current texture over the restored 96m interaction domain. Its second pass
  rasterizes at most 16 persistent world-space Morlet-style wavelets (compact, Gaussian-
  windowed 6–10m oscillating crests, not closed blur bubbles or repeated trains). Their CPU
  centres/lifetimes/directions/phases are transported through the same
  `WaterSampler.velocity_at()` field and turn with the shared vorticity as that field bends.
  The packet height is
  CPU-mirrored to character buoyancy. Plunge mist (particle spray at fall landings) is currently
  unwired — a follow-up; the shared particle resources it needs are no longer warmed on
  startup. `tests/tools/water_review_spots.gd` emits F4 review teleports
  (`ReviewTeleporter.gd` reads `review_teleports.json` and lifts the player onto streamed
  ground if a stale spot height would bury them).
  **Character depth gate** (`characters/character.gd`): classification is **static-field
  depth**, full stop — `depth = sampler.level_at(xz) - global_position.y`, read from the
  overlapping trigger's frozen `WaterSampler` snapshot (the knee-height probe only finds
  which triggers overlap; it plays no part in the depth number itself). Swim and wade are
  each hysteretic against that static number — swim ENTER at depth > 0.8m, EXIT at < 0.6m;
  wade ENTER at depth > 0.05m, EXIT at < 0.03m — so a reading sitting right on one boundary
  can't dither the state every frame. `wading = in_water or (deepest static depth clears the
  wade gate)` (since h-task-4): swimming is a DEEPER case of being in water at all, so a
  swimming character always reads wading too — never independently false while `in_water` is
  true. The **dynamic height** (ambient `_swell_offset` plus `WaterRippleSim`'s exact CPU
  packet mirror) feeds ONLY `water_surface_y`, the float-height buoyancy chase — NEVER the depth gate: letting the
  swell's own crest nudge the gate used to be able to latch a false swim state on a single
  crest-timed frame at a knife-edge shoreline depth, which is why classification reads the
  static field alone.
- **One ground appearance field**: the shared `ground_palette.tres` atlas and
  `BiomeRegistry.ground_tint_at` still identify turf, rock and path. Terrain,
  rolled turf lips and dense grass all apply `ground_style.gdshaderinc` to turf,
  sampling `BiomeGroundMap`'s seven weights and canonical linear substrate
  colours. Broad moss, chalk, silt, petal and earth patterns remain world-aligned.
  Rock and path texels retain their authored palette. Change the shared field
  once; never give a ground consumer its own copied colour.
- **Global lighting and local atmosphere**: `AtmosphereDirector` owns one fixed
  warm sun (energy 1.2, shadow opacity 0.65), cool ambient fill, restrained glow,
  matte contact shading and adjustable camera focus. It updates only the
  deterministic ground lookup as the player travels; a biome boundary can never
  change distant lighting. World mist supplies regional depth and colour.

## Character & camera

- **`characters/character.gd`** (`CharacterBody3D`) — movement (accel / friction / turn),
  `_try_step_up` (climb ≤ `MAX_STEP_HEIGHT` ledges), jump, and **force-based swimming**: water
  tiles expose an `Area3D` on collision layer 8; while a knee-height probe is inside it,
  `WaterForces` supplies buoyancy proportional to submerged fraction and enough full-submersion
  lift for a stable passive float. Horizontal drag carries the character toward the exact
  `WaterSampler` current while player steering remains relative to that moving water. Holding
  jump adds thrust, and pressing toward a nearby bank wall launches the character out. Verified
  by `tests/harness/swim_harness.tscn`.
- **`scripts/controllers/`** — a pluggable `CharacterController` resource: `PlayerController`
  (keyboard, camera-relative) and `TestController` (steers toward a target node, for harnesses).
- **`scripts/camera/camera.gd`** — orbit camera (Q/E orbit) following the character. The general
  `CameraObstructionSolver` sweeps one sphere upward to lower the framing pivot beneath ceilings
  and outward to shorten the boom against world collision. It excludes the player body, snaps
  inward for safety, and releases pivot/boom length smoothly even while the player is stationary;
  buildings, cliffs, decks, and future dungeons need no camera-specific hooks.

## Startup loading screen

- **`ui/loading_screens/mythos_loading_screen.tscn`** is the project main scene. It loads
  `world.tscn` on Godot's threaded resource loader, installs the live world behind a high
  `CanvasLayer`, and keeps its animated atlas visible until `FieldTerrainStreamer` reports
  every chunk within one terrain cell of the player's spawn integrated. The production spawn sits
  0.5 m inside the origin chunk, avoiding a four-way collision seam, while the readiness gate still
  includes every nearby quadrant the camera can reveal. Startup progress is real weighted
  work: threaded scene-resource loading, worker
  FeatureContext/heightfield/mesh/water/dressing milestones for those support jobs and
  their required feature halo, then main-thread integration. Never replace it with elapsed-time
  progress. `MythosLoadingScreen.gd` owns the handoff,
  `MythosTaperedProgressBar.gd` draws the hairline/tapered fill, and
  `mythos_loading_screen.gdshader` composites transparent city/cloud/chart textures from
  `ui/loading_screens/layers/` over the genuinely cloud-free
  `mythos_mythic_atlas_background_cloudless.png` plate; never restore the older plate's static
  corner-cloud duplicates. Only the chart texture rotates; four cloud groups translate
  independently. The stationary river is the actual original atlas painting, with a second atlas
  sample travelling downstream along a hand-fitted river spine for most of each cycle and
  cross-fading only at wrap. Its moving mask is the narrower inner channel, never the full painted
  bank width. Fine distant wavelets are low-contrast and screen-horizontal for perspective even
  though the underlying texture advection follows the spline. The title/progress Control remains
  outside every rotation.

## Conventions & code style

- **Typed GDScript.** Annotate function signatures, exported vars, and members. Inline `:=`
  type inference is used freely for locals — match the surrounding code.
- **Purity boundary.** Terrain computation (plan / field / mesher / dressing) stays
  scene-free and deterministic so it can be unit-tested headless. Push scene-tree work into the
  streamer or scene glue.
- **Simplify — the owner strongly prefers root-cause re-architecture over band-aids.** If the
  same logic appears in several places, consolidate it. If you're adding retries, attempt loops,
  or a special case for "only when tag/config X", step back and redesign so the normal path just
  works. Prefer shorter code. (This is why the socket engine was replaced wholesale rather than
  patched.)

## Tests & harnesses (`tests/`)

- Unit tests mirror the pipeline: `test_heightfield_plan`, `test_heightfield_region`,
  `test_heightfield_clamp_step`, `test_terrain_surface_field`, `test_terrain_chunk_mesher`,
  `test_cliff_dressing`, `test_dressing_field`, `test_dressing_ecology`,
  `test_dressing_collision_builder`, `test_dressing_commit_queue`,
  `test_environment_catalog`, `test_water_field_context`, `test_field_streamer`, `test_biomes`,
  `test_helper`, `test_world_field_block_cache`, `test_water_path_queries`, `test_settlement_plan`, `test_path_program`,
  `test_path_plan_nodes`, `test_path_bridge_sites`, `test_path_route_solver`,
  `test_path_context`, `test_path_features`, and the `test_slope_*` profile/geometry guards. Continuity guards
  (`test_slope_tile_continuity`, `test_diag_seams`, `test_slope_socket_grounding`) assert the
  surface is gap-free and dressing sits on the mesh — the invariants above, encoded.
- **`tests/harness/`** — visual/screenshot scenes for eyeballing behavior a unit test can't
  (`heightfield_shot.tscn`, `hf_shapes.tscn`, `swim_harness.tscn`,
  `environment_lineup.tscn`, `teleport_deco_harness.tscn`, `debug_water.tscn`, …). The lineup
  pages the full generated catalogue with stable IDs, provenance, measured AABBs, a one-metre
  scale marker, and optional collision overlays (`--show-collision`). The teleport harness streams
  a fixed nine-chunk site through the real world pipeline, requires structural collision, and
  waits for both terrain integration and the independent dressing commit queue before capturing it.
  `path_review.tscn` renders straight/L/T/X/logical-node masks through the real terrain mesher beside the
  rejected offset-width alternative; `path_corpus.gd` is the deterministic smoke/full path gate.

## Adding terrain content

- **New environment visual**: add a stable-ID entry to the relevant manifest under
  `tools/environment_bake/manifests/`, including its canonical bake scale and either
  `collision_source`, a supported `collision_profile`, or intentionally neither. `tree`, `rock`,
  and `deadwood` tags require collision by construction. Prefer one close-fitting simple shape:
  `trunk_capsule` for a straight grounded lower trunk or `trunk_capsule_chain` for a reviewed
  curved trunk. A forked or root-heavy silhouette can explicitly provide
  `collision_joint_points_m` and `collision_segment_radii_m` in corrected asset-local metres,
  keeping asset-specific art direction in the manifest rather than the generic baker.
  Use `oriented_cylinder` for a log,
  `stump_cylinder` for a flat cut, `flat_box`/`flat_rock` for a walkable rock, and set
  `collision_component_count` when one source visual contains several disconnected stones; use
  `collision_max_height` plus the `walkover` tag for a low obstacle that must remain below the
  character step at every active population scale; use `oriented_capsule` for a branch. Use
  `collision_source` only for reviewed authored primitives.
  Run the bake tool and review every rigid asset beside its mesh in
  `environment_lineup.tscn -- --show-collision`; a proxy must not stray materially outside the
  mesh or collapse to an unusably thin line. Never add a runtime wrapper scene or a source-pack
  path.
- **New ambient population or variant**: author a `DressingSet`/`DressingChoice` under
  `terrain/dressing/` and add it to `terrain/dressing/index.tres`. The set owns direct per-biome
  fill and may share habitat/community channels with related sets; visual choices affect mix,
  never population. Structural sets must share the appropriate spacing group so their collision
  cannot overlap. The compiler derives proposal slots and margins and rejects illegal
  water/support/radius combinations. Author `feature_clearance` explicitly (`2.0` m for rigid
  structure, `0.3` m for small ground cover, `0.0` for floating lilies); the compiler rejects a
  margin outside `PathProgram`'s saturated clearance coverage.
- **New man-made path feature**: add its self-contained visual/collision through the environment
  manifest, then add only primitive footprint/support/opening semantics to `PathProgram`. Keep the
  decision inside `PathPlan` after final route-mask merge, add its footprint to the shared
  reservation union, derive its stable ID from the canonical world site, and let the existing
  environment payload/builder/queue and derived feature halo handle streaming. Do not add a
  sibling planner, scene wrapper, feature-specific streamer dependency list, or alternate water/
  terrain classifier. Review paths in `tests/harness/path_review.tscn`, assets in
  `environment_lineup.tscn -- --show-collision`, and deterministic statistics with
  `tests/harness/path_corpus.gd`.
- **Different cliff dressing**: change the stable asset IDs in `CliffDressing.ASSETS` (pieces
  must tile on the 3 m / 10.5 grid — mismatched module widths leave slits at the corners).
- **Tuning terrain shape**: `FieldTerrainStreamer` exports (amplitude, storey cap, cliff step,
  radii), `HeightfieldPlan` constants (`STOREY_HEIGHT`, `LEVELS_PER_STOREY`, aggregation), and
  `Helper` field scales (`MACRO_SCALE`, biome/water scales).

## Before finishing

- **Run the tests** (`godot-test`) and fix regressions before considering a change done. For
  anything visual, also open a relevant `tests/harness/` scene (or the game) and look.
- **For a reported visual defect, use red-first TDD plus active falsification.** Pin the exact
  seed/world coordinates and camera pose, write the smallest failing invariant before the fix,
  then rerun it green. When an F3 screenshot supplies `player world` + `crosshair world`, use
  `ReviewCam.solve_cam`/`ReviewCam.shoot`; never substitute a hand-authored camera transform.
  Capture the same-angle before/after view and deliberately
  try to prove the defect still exists: inspect alternate times/nearby angles, paired animation
  frames, seams, and likely collateral regressions. Reject a change if the unit test passes but
  the matched render exposes the original problem or a new artifact. Keep a deterministic
  self-driving harness for recurring review sites; `tests/harness/water_reported_qa.tscn` is the
  water example and accepts `-- --spot <name>` for a focused run.
- If you rename/move a `class_name` script, run the `--import` step above.

## Historical docs (stale — do not follow as current)

These predate or partially describe the retired socket engine and are kept only for history:
`terrain/TERRAIN_README.md`, `docs/known-issues/*`, most of `docs/future-work/*`, the older
`docs/superpowers/plans|specs/*`, and `docs/superpowers/terrain-status-2026-06-24.md`. When they
conflict with the code, the code and this file win. The living design reference is
`docs/mythosunwritten-master-design.md`.
# September 8 garden border follow-up

Continuous horizontal facade runs select one shared available outcrop depth
before emitting their paired panels. They do not alternate deep and shallow
projections along one garden edge. Shallow covering boards fit their own
projection depth and retain the wall-top bearing plane. The matched September 8
photo 1 and nearby views, actual board bounds, and identical west-town clearance
across 140 cells and 205 crossings verify the change.

# Generation Lag and "Map Edge Stall"

## Symptom

After changing blocking behavior for missing `socket_fill_prob` keys, generation became noticeably laggier and appeared to stop keeping up with player movement ("can run to edge of map").

## Repro

1. Use current branch with non-blocking missing key behavior.
2. Run the game headless (or run integration tests with debug counters):
   - `godot --headless --path /Users/ryko/story`
   - `godot --path /Users/ryko/story -s res://addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gconfig=res://tests/gutconfig.json -gtest=res://tests/test_terrain_generator.gd`
3. Observe early generation debug in `test_integration_default_level_generation_forms_cluster_early`.

## Profile Data Collected

Instrumentation was added inside `_DebugTerrainGenerator._process_socket` in tests.

Representative run:

- `debug_time_us={ "process_socket_total": 7170793, "resolve_context": 902230, "try_place_with_rules": 6235929, "forbidden_scan": 4404 }`

Interpretation:

- `try_place_with_rules` dominates runtime (~6.24s of ~7.17s).
- Forbidden-adjacency scanning itself is negligible.
- Primary cost is placement attempt path (sampling, spawn/create, add/collision/rules).

## Why It Feels Like Generation Halts

In measured runs, generation was still progressing, but not fast enough relative to movement:

- `iter=220 level_tiles=293 open_level_cardinal=354 blocked_same_layer=818`

This suggests frontier still exists (`open_level_cardinal` > 0), but throughput per frame is insufficient, creating a perceived stall at render/generation boundary.

## Additional Root-Cause Context (High Confidence)

Repeated same-cell attempts from ground `topcenter` appear to amplify load:

- Ground expanders are present in socket-pair logs against level top sockets.
- `_is_socket_connected()` currently gates only same-layer matches.
- Ground `topcenter` sockets can remain "open" even when a level tile already occupies that vertical column.

That leads to repeated expensive processing cycles that often fail later in placement/rule checks, increasing frame-time pressure and contributing to perceived generation stalls.

## Fixes Attempted

### Attempt A: Missing keys non-blocking

- Increased available adjacency paths.
- Side effect: more candidate processing and more expensive generation.
- Status: **introduced performance side effects**.

### Attempt B: Reduce placement retries

- `_try_place_with_rules` changed from 4 attempts to 1.
- Profiling improved somewhat but hotspot remained dominant:
  - before approx: `try_place_with_rules` ~6.8s
  - after approx: `try_place_with_rules` ~6.2s
- Status: **partial improvement**, insufficient alone.

## Likely Root Cause

The big cost is cumulative work in `_try_place_with_rules` pipeline:

- module sampling
- instantiation (`spawn`/`create`)
- transform/collision placement checks
- rule application and possible replacement/removal operations

Allowing more non-blocking adjacency expands the candidate search space and number of expensive attempts.

## Recommended Fix Strategy

1. **Stabilize semantics first**:
   - Make socket config explicit, avoid accidental non-blocking via omissions.
2. **Reduce expensive failed attempts**:
   - Pre-filter more aggressively before spawn/create where possible.
3. **Budget work per frame**:
   - Tune dynamic cap by frame time, not fixed `MAX_LOAD_PER_STEP`.
4. **Avoid repeated expensive checks**:
   - Cache reusable adjacency/context info per socket pop.
5. **Measure each change**:
   - Keep existing debug timing counters while iterating.

## Additional Notes

- Headless startup runs succeeded (warnings only for invalid UIDs resolving via text path).
- Lag issue appears algorithmic/load-related, not crash-related.

## March 2026 Deep Investigation (Queue-Focused)

### New Repro/Instrumentation Tests

Added deterministic integration tests and queue instrumentation in `tests/test_terrain_generator.gd`:

- `test_integration_moving_player_frontier_keeps_generating_ground`
- `test_integration_out_of_range_requeue_does_not_duplicate_and_recovers`

Added debug helpers/counters:

- queue health snapshots (`queue_size`, duplicate entry count)
- out-of-range defer counts by socket name (`deferred_socket_counts`)
- moving-frontier starvation signals (`longest_zero_placement_streak`)

### Root Cause (Confirmed)

The "edge stall + lag spike" behavior was primarily queue churn and queue correctness:

1. **Duplicate queue entries were possible** for the same `(piece, socket)` and could accumulate.
2. **Out-of-range sockets were immediately requeued**, allowing same-frame churn and wasted processing budget.
3. **Connection checks used only one hit** at a socket position, despite `PositionIndex` storing multiple sockets per snapped position.

This combined into low effective throughput near the moving frontier even though generation was still "running."

### Code Fixes Implemented

#### `scripts/terrain/TerrainGenerator.gd`

- Added queue-key tracking for one-entry-per-socket dedupe.
- Added deferred requeue staging:
  - out-of-range sockets are staged during `load_terrain()`
  - re-enqueued once after the main pop/process loop
  - prevents same-frame pop/requeue churn loops
- Batched linked-socket queue removal in one `remove_where` pass.
- Updated `_is_socket_connected()` to treat a socket as connected if **any** overlapping other socket is expandable.

#### `scripts/terrain/PositionIndex.gd`

- Added `query_others(pos, piece)` to return all overlapping sockets at a snapped position.

#### `scripts/core/PriorityQueue.gd`

- `remove_where()` now returns the number of removed entries (supports queue maintenance instrumentation/cleanup paths).

### Collected Logs (Post-Fix)

From:

`godot --path /Users/ryko/story -s res://addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gconfig=res://tests/gutconfig.json -gtest=res://tests/test_terrain_generator.gd`

`moving-frontier-debug`:

- `player_x=828.0`
- `max_ground_x=1008.0` (frontier remained ahead of player)
- `queue_peak=829`
- `duplicate_entry_peak=0`
- `no_ground_near_player_checks=0`
- `longest_zero_placement_streak=2`
- `deferred_total=152`
- `placed_total=1080`

`requeue-recovery-debug`:

- `queue_size_during_deferral_peak=230`
- `duplicate_entry_peak=0`
- `deferred_total_after_far=2800`
- `placed_before_far=335`
- `placed_after_recovery=518`

Interpretation:

- Duplicate queue growth is eliminated (`duplicate_entry_peak=0`).
- Generation recovers after long out-of-range periods (`placed_after_recovery > placed_before_far`).
- Moving-frontier run maintained nearby ground and kept frontier ahead of player.

### Current Status

- Core queue bug/optimization issue has a concrete fix in place.
- Remaining full-suite failures are the pre-existing test regressions documented in `current-regressions-and-test-state.md` (deprecated private-method calls), not this queue fix.

## March 2026 Ongoing Profiling: `_try_place_with_rules` Still Dominant

### Goal

Continue reducing `_try_place_with_rules` runtime after queue-churn root cause was fixed.

### Debug Session Summary

- Runtime logging session: `aeacc0`
- Log path: `res://.cursor/debug-aeacc0.log`
- Focused paths:
  - `TerrainGenerator._try_place_with_rules`
  - `TerrainGenerator._apply_rules_after_placement`
  - `TerrainGenerator.add_piece`
  - `LevelEdgeRule.apply`

### Hypotheses and Outcomes

1. `rules_us` dominates `_try_place_with_rules`:
   - **CONFIRMED**
   - Example logs:
     - `try_place_slow_success total_us=88037 add_piece_us=1646 rules_us=86302`
     - `try_place_slow_success total_us=31538 add_piece_us=1585 rules_us=29904`
2. `add_piece` dominates the same path:
   - **PARTIAL / SECONDARY**
   - `add_piece` can be expensive, but in the worst `_try_place_with_rules` events, `rules_us` remains much larger.
3. Two rule passes are duplicated expensive work:
   - **CONFIRMED**
   - `slow_rule_apply` events occurred on both `pass=0` and `pass=1` before optimization.
4. `get_adjacent` fetch is the major rule sub-cost:
   - **REJECTED (for observed runs)**
   - No `slow_adjacent_fetch` events at configured threshold.

### Fixes Attempted (Runtime-Evidence Driven)

#### Attempt C: Reduce post-placement rule passes

- Change: `_apply_rules_after_placement` from `range(2)` to `range(1)`.
- Evidence after change:
  - `slow_rule_apply` logs now only appear for `pass=0`.
  - `_try_place_with_rules` remains rule-dominant but with fewer duplicate pass events.
- Status: **confirmed partial improvement**.

### LevelEdgeRule Internal Breakdown (New Evidence)

Instrumentation added inside `LevelEdgeRule.apply` to split:

- `neighbors_us`
- `missing_total_us`
- `replacement_total_us`

Representative events:

- `affected_count=1 direct_neighbors=0 missing_total_us=24 neighbors_us=101 replacement_total_us=40253 total_us=40382`
- `affected_count=12 direct_neighbors=4 missing_total_us=931 neighbors_us=627 replacement_total_us=4525 total_us=6090`
- `affected_count=15 direct_neighbors=6 missing_total_us=1499 neighbors_us=817 replacement_total_us=3254 total_us=5579`

Interpretation:

- `replacement_total_us` is often the largest component.
- In large neighborhoods, both `missing_total_us` and `replacement_total_us` are significant.
- There is at least one extreme outlier where replacement work dominates almost entirely.

### Current Working Theory

`LevelEdgeRule.apply` spends substantial time in per-affected-piece replacement selection/creation, and this dominates rule cost under dense level neighborhoods.

### Next Instrumentation (Added During Investigation)

To validate no-op replacement churn potential, logging now includes:

- `same_tag_candidates`: affected pieces where target variant tag already matches current piece.
- `no_change_candidates`: stricter subset where tag matches and canonical alignment is already `0` steps.

This is intended to prove/disprove whether we can safely skip replacement creation for a meaningful fraction of affected pieces.

### March 2026 Follow-up Evidence: No-op Replacement Churn (Confirmed)

Latest `perf-round3` samples show `same_tag_candidates` and `no_change_candidates` are frequently high:

- `affected_count=12 same_tag_candidates=10 no_change_candidates=9 replacement_total_us=4208 total_us=6937`
- `affected_count=17 same_tag_candidates=12 no_change_candidates=12 replacement_total_us=6812 total_us=11641`
- `affected_count=8 same_tag_candidates=7 no_change_candidates=7 replacement_total_us=2709 total_us=4713`

Interpretation:

- A significant share of affected pieces already have the target level tag and required alignment.
- We were still spending replacement time even when no visual/state change was needed.

### Attempt D: Skip No-op Replacements in `LevelEdgeRule`

Implemented:

- In `LevelEdgeRule.apply`, compute `target_tag` and `steps_to_align` once per affected piece.
- New helper `_create_replacement_for_target(source_piece, target_tag, steps_to_align)`.
- Fast-return `source_piece` when:
  - existing tag already equals target tag, and
  - `steps_to_align == 0`.

Verification instrumentation used an extra metric:

- `no_change_skips` (actual number of replacements skipped at runtime)

Expected effect:

- Reduce `replacement_total_us` proportionally to no-op candidate frequency.
- Lower `rules_us` contribution inside `_try_place_with_rules`.

### Attempt D Verification (Post-change Runtime Evidence)

Post-change logs (same scenario) now show `no_change_skips` firing frequently and replacement cost reduced:

- `affected_count=9 no_change_candidates=6 no_change_skips=6 replacement_total_us=638 total_us=2463`
- `affected_count=8 no_change_candidates=5 no_change_skips=5 replacement_total_us=457 total_us=2124`
- `affected_count=10 no_change_candidates=5 no_change_skips=5 replacement_total_us=1337 total_us=4070`

Compared to pre-change runs, many similar neighborhood sizes previously showed replacement totals in the ~2k-5k range.

Status: **confirmed improvement** for recurring LevelEdge retile workload.

Additional post-change run confirms this pattern:

- `no_change_skips` consistently tracks a large share of affected pieces.
- `replacement_total_us` is commonly around ~0.4k-1.5k in many events where earlier runs were often ~2k-5k for similar neighborhood sizes.
- `_try_place_with_rules` still shows occasional high spikes, but typical `rules_us` values are materially lower than earlier heavy clusters.

### Remaining Issue

A first-use outlier is still visible:

- `affected_count=1 replacement_total_us=40007 total_us=40292`

Likely cause is one-time lazy setup/warm-up in level variant selection paths (not repeated in later events).

### Next Profiling Step Added

Added `tag_eval_total_us` metric in `LevelEdgeRule.apply` to separate:

- missing-socket cost (`missing_total_us`)
- tag/rotation classification cost (`tag_eval_total_us`)
- replacement work (`replacement_total_us`)

This was used to identify the next dominant cost after no-op replacement skips.

### Post-investigation Cleanup

- Debug instrumentation added for this profiling session has been removed from runtime code.
- Retained code changes:
  - single-pass `_apply_rules_after_placement` (`range(1)`)
  - no-op replacement skip in `LevelEdgeRule` via `_create_replacement_for_target(...)`.

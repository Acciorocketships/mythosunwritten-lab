# Startup + terrain-generation profiling — findings and optimization plan (2026-08-15)

Profiled on branch `feat/mass-first-warren`, world seed pinned to `2697992464`
([world.tscn:57](../../../scenes/world.tscn)). Three evidence sources:

1. **Live game log** of Ryan's editor-embedded run (Aug 15 21:29,
   `~/Library/Application Support/Godot/app_userdata/Story/logs/godot.log`) —
   the streamer's own `[terrain-streamer]` heartbeat/phase instrumentation.
2. **Headless production-faithful profiler**
   `tests/harness/profile_startup_pipeline.gd` (new; mirrors
   `FieldTerrainStreamer._ready()` exactly), run twice with an isolated
   `user://`: **warm** (copy of the current pin cache) and **cold** (empty pin
   cache = true first boot).
3. Code audit (startup path, streaming pipeline, per-frame costs) with
   file:line evidence.

---

## TL;DR

| Symptom | Root cause | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| Startup takes minutes | Warren/settlement production search runs **inside the startup loading gate**, serialized on the **single** terrain worker, in 20 s budget slices whose *first attempt is uncapped* | Live: **154.5 s** to `startup_complete`. Cold headless: ~128 s of the gate is search + cold water trace |
| Terrain doesn't load before the player reaches the edge | Same search monopolizes the one worker for 15–75 s **per chunk** near unsolved settlements, while finished terrain **cannot integrate** because its 3×3 feature halo isn't ready | Live: `built` frozen at 9 chunks for ~8 minutes with 16–28 computed chunks stuck in `pending` |
| Streaming feels slow even away from villages | Terrain mesh compute is **83 %** of a chunk build — ~9 216 quads × dozens of interpreted GDScript calls each | 1.35 s avg/chunk (mesh 1.12 s); worst 2.8 s |
| (bonus) frame-time waste in normal play | Debug overlay raycasting every frame, allocation storms in water sampling, trample-field rebuilds | see §6 |

The **startup problem and the streaming problem are the same problem**: the
village solver owns the only build thread, and the integration gate turns one
slow feature block into a frozen world.

## 1. Measured startup timeline (live run, seed 2697992464)

`startup_complete elapsed_ms=154532`. Where it went:

| t (s) | Phase | Evidence (log) |
|---|---|---|
| 0–~2 | `world.tscn` instantiate + `FieldTerrainStreamer._ready()` (program compiles, asset prepare) | headless: `READY_TOTAL 1775 ms` (feature program compile **981 ms**, dressing compile **460 ms**, catalog **186 ms**, render-cache prepare 62 assets **139 ms**) |
| ~0–36 | Chunk (0,0) `feature_context` = **36.1 s** — contains the **cold water trace/region cache (~28 s)** (cold_plan hit 1.0 at t≈30) + spawn settlement search slice | `worker_phase … phase=feature_placements previous=feature_context previous_ms=36083` |
| 36–37 | Chunk (0,0) mesh 824 ms, dressing 231 ms | `previous_ms=824`, `previous_ms=231` |
| 37–45 | Chunk (-1,-1): feature_context **7.3 s**, then ~1.1 s build | `previous_ms=7286` |
| 45–58 | Ring-1 chunks ~1–2.4 s each. **Defect observed:** non-support chunk (-1,1) built before support (0,-1) — see §4.3 | job_complete lines |
| 58–116 | Chunk (-2,-2) — a **halo feature key** the gate waits on — `feature_context` = **55.8 s** (village search slice) | `previous_ms=55838`; heartbeats stuck at `progress=0.9025 ready=1/4` for 55 s |
| 116–142 | Chunk (-2,-1) `feature_context` = **25.3 s** | `previous_ms=25291` |
| 142–154.5 | Remaining halo keys + supports integrate; gate opens | `startup_complete … elapsed_ms=154532` |

**Startup ≈ 28 s cold water plan + ~90 s settlement searches + ~20 s meshing
+ ~2 s setup + tail.** The loading bar sat at 0.90 for a full minute because
the gate's 16 feature keys include halo chunks that touch a settlement
super-cell.

Headless replay of the same gate work:

| | contexts (16 keys) | 4 support builds | total gate work |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Warm** (current pins) | 33.9 s (key (-2,-2) alone 31.3 s) | 3.6 s | **37.5 s** |
| **Cold** (first boot, no pins) | **206.6 s** | 3.6 s | **210.2 s** |

Cold per-key: (-2,-2) **73.3 s**, (0,1) **71.7 s**, (0,0) **21.6 s**,
(-2,-1) **20.6 s**, (0,-2) **12.0 s**, (1,0) 6.4 s — separate
searches/slices for the settlements whose discovery radius overlaps the spawn
halo. After that entire 3.5-minute "first boot", the pin cache held two
failure pins and one `attempts_tried: 3` progress pin — i.e. a **second**
boot still resumes searching. The search journey spans launches by design;
today the player's loading screen and streaming worker pay for it.

## 2. Post-startup: why the world stops streaming (live log)

Immediately after the gate opened, the player walked south-west toward a
settlement. The single worker then spent **45–75 s per chunk** in
`feature_context`:

```
elapsed 180s..225s  chunk -3,-3  feature_context ≥60 s   built=9  pending=16
elapsed 253s..298s  chunk -4,-3  feature_context ≥60 s   built=9  pending=18
elapsed 326s..386s  chunk -4,-2  feature_context ≥75 s   built=9  pending=19
elapsed 406s..451s  chunk -3,-2  feature_context ≥60 s   built=9  pending=21
elapsed 469s..607s  -3,-1 / -5,* … 15–30 s each          built 9→35
```

For ~8 minutes `built` stayed at 9 while 16–28 fully-computed terrain
payloads sat in `_pending_terrain` — they may not integrate until every block
of their 3×3 feature halo is ready
([FieldTerrainStreamer.gd:852](../../../scripts/terrain/field/FieldTerrainStreamer.gd),
`_feature_square_ready`), and those blocks were queued behind one
village search after another on the one worker. **This is the
"terrain doesn't load before I reach the edge of the world" bug.** It is not
meshing throughput and not (primarily) prioritization — it is the search
serialized in front of everything else.

Mechanics of the search cost
([VillageWarrenFabricSolver.gd:13,49-52](../../../scripts/terrain/features/villages/VillageWarrenFabricSolver.gd),
[WarrenVolumetricSolver.gd:136-142](../../../scripts/terrain/features/villages/fabric/WarrenVolumetricSolver.gd),
[VillagePlan.gd:44-47](../../../scripts/terrain/features/villages/VillagePlan.gd)):

- `PRODUCTION_SEARCH_BUDGET_MS = 20000` per record build, but **the first
  attempt of each slice runs to completion** (observed 45–75 s phases).
- A budget-interrupted record is **deliberately not cached**, so *every*
  feature key whose discovery radius touches the same unsolved settlement
  re-enters the solver and burns another slice. The pin cache
  (`user://warren_solution_pins.json`) persists progress
  (`attempts_tried`) across slices/boots, so the search does converge — but
  the worker pays the whole journey in the player's face.
- Docs already record 78–408 s per settlement full searches
  (2026-08-12-town-quality-remediation.md).

## 3. Steady-state chunk economics (headless, warm caches)

21-chunk sweep, radius 2, away from unsolved-village slices:

| Phase | avg ms/chunk | share |
|---|---|---|
| `mesher.compute_chunk` | **1 124** | **83 %** |
| `DressingField.compute` | 165 | 12 % |
| commit (main thread: meshes+collision+multimesh) | 40 | 3 % |
| heightfield region | 10 | — |
| water context (warm) | 2 | — |
| feature context (warm) | 3 | — |
| **Total** | **1 349** | worst 2 799 (near village: mesh 1.75–1.9 s) |

Grass: 52 tiles built in 1.85 s (**36 ms avg**, worst 55 ms) — cheap.

**Demand vs supply at MAX_SPEED = 10 m/s** (192 m chunks, radius 3):
straight-line movement needs a new 7-chunk column every 19.2 s →
0.365 chunk/s → **49 % worker duty** at 1.35 s/chunk; diagonal ~65 %; grass
adds ~10 %. So normal streaming *just about* keeps up — there is no slack.
One 20–75 s search slice costs 15–55 chunks of build time; the ring collapses
and the player reaches the frontier. The mesher's 1.1 s is what makes the
system fragile; the search is what breaks it.

Why the mesh phase is 1.1 s
([TerrainChunkMesher.gd:99-282](../../../scripts/terrain/field/TerrainChunkMesher.gd)):
`GRID = 96` → **9 216 quads/chunk**; per quad: 4 baked samples, 4 clip-vert
checks, a path-candidacy probe fan (`_emit_path_surface` — up to ~20+
`FeatureGroundField` probes on the rejection path, ~230 k queries/chunk even
when no path exists anywhere near), and ~18 SurfaceTool per-vertex calls;
then `st.index()` + `generate_normals()` over ~55 k verts. It is interpreter-
call-bound, not math-bound.

## 4. Prioritization defects (secondary, but they bite at saturation)

1. **Stale distance ratchet.** `_request_job_locked` takes
   `mini(old, new)` for `priority_distance`/`priority_tier`
   ([FieldTerrainStreamer.gd:1028-1029](../../../scripts/terrain/field/FieldTerrainStreamer.gd)).
   Distances are never *raised*, so chunks behind a moving player keep their
   old close-distance priority and tie with (or beat) the chunks ahead.
   Terrain jobs are also never cancelled when they leave the radius (only
   grass has `_cancel_far_grass_jobs_locked`) — the worker happily spends
   1.35 s each on chunks the player is running away from, and `_drain_results`
   then throws the payload away if it's beyond KEEP_RADIUS.
2. **Grass outranks far terrain.** Grass jobs are tier 2; terrain beyond the
   84 m grass radius is tier 3 ([:967-974,:1093](../../../scripts/terrain/field/FieldTerrainStreamer.gd)).
   While moving, ~2.9 new grass tiles/s continuously pre-empt the terrain
   frontier — pretty grass at your feet, void on the horizon.
3. **Halo-tier leakage, both directions.** `_drain_results` requests the 8
   feature-halo jobs with the *drained chunk's* tier/distance ([:791-802]).
   For the centre chunk that is tier 0 — observed live: non-support chunk
   (-1,1) (merged into a full terrain job) built **before** support chunk
   (0,-1) during startup. For non-centre chunks the halo jobs land at tier
   1/3 even though integration (and the startup gate, and the player
   unfreeze) is blocked on them.
4. **No direction-of-motion bias.** `desired_chunks` is a symmetric square;
   priority is Chebyshev distance only. At 10 m/s the ~8 s lead time of the
   tier-1 band is marginal.
5. **FIFO commit queues.** `FeatureCommitQueue` (1 asset load/frame, 24
   shapes, 2.5 ms) and `EnvironmentCommitQueue` (2 batches/frame) drain in
   insertion order — a far village block consumes the budget ahead of the
   near block the player is frozen on.

## 5. Startup-specific costs outside the worker

- `_ready` main-thread block ≈ **1.8 s** headless (feature program compile
  981 ms — ~146 `FabricRecipe` literals; dressing compile 460 ms; catalog
  load + 394 `ResourceLoader.exists` probes 186 ms; 62 visual loads 139 ms).
- Loading screen itself: ~7.9 MB of PNGs decoded before anything else.
- Every chunk integrate builds `BiomeChunkFx` (GPUParticles3D + FogVolume +
  OmniLight3D) with **no particle warm-up** → first-use shader-compile
  hitches during/after loading.
- Gate tail: `MAX_BUILD_PER_FRAME = 1` (≥4 frames) + 0.45 s fade.

## 6. Normal-gameplay per-frame findings (bonus audit)

Ranked by value-per-effort:

1. **`CoordOverlay` ships enabled** ([CoordOverlay.gd:12](../../../scripts/terrain/tools/CoordOverlay.gd)):
   every frame does a **4 000 m `intersect_ray`**, two absolute-path
   `get_node_or_null` lookups, 5-noise biome sampling, ~6 format strings, 9
   `loaded_storey_at` calls, and an unconditional `Label.text` assignment
   (TextServer re-shape). Default it off / throttle to 10 Hz.
2. **`WaterSampler._corners` allocates 4 nested Arrays per call**
   ([WaterSampler.gd:157-171](../../../scripts/terrain/water/WaterSampler.gd));
   `level_at`/`velocity_at`/`flow_diagnostics_at` each re-call it.
   `WaterRippleSim._refresh_flow_texture` runs a 32×32 grid × linear scan of
   all water samplers every ≤0.5 s (~20–40 k allocations per refresh);
   the character's swim probe pays the same per physics tick. Return packed
   floats / locals instead; add a Rect2 bounds pre-test per sampler;
   refresh samplers only on chunk load/evict.
3. **`TrampleField`**: 256² `get_pixel`/`set_pixel` epoch loop = a
   **guaranteed hitch every 60 s** ([TrampleField.gd:172-183](../../../scripts/terrain/grass/TrampleField.gd));
   `_publish_globals` re-sets 5 global shader params every frame; and the
   static-stamp image is fully rebuilt (all ~81 chunks' stamps, deep-copied)
   on **every chunk integrate and evict** ([FieldTerrainStreamer.gd:865-866,702-703,876-888])
   — i.e. precisely when streaming is already busy.
4. **Streamer `_process` sweeps**: `desired_chunks` allocation + O(49 ×
   pending) `_has_pending_terrain` scans + three full `_built`/`_feature_ready`
   keys() sweeps run every frame regardless of movement; `_pending_terrain`
   sort_custom runs even when empty; `_request_job_locked` re-sorts the whole
   job queue under the mutex for every already-queued chunk each frame
   (~dozens of sorts/frame with a deep backlog). Gate on `centre` change.
5. **`GrassStreamer`**: exact-float LOD origin means `origin_changed` every
   frame → full tile×batch visible-count walk + evict rebuild; `desired_tiles`
   sort allocates ~700 Rect2/frame in its comparator. Quantize the origin.
6. **`character.gd`**: fresh `PhysicsPointQueryParameters3D` +
   `get_first_node_in_group("water_dynamics")` every swim tick; string-path
   `anim_tree.get/set` per tick; `KinematicCollision3D.new()` in step-up.
   Cache all four.
7. **`camera.gd`/`CameraObstructionSolver`**: 2 shape-casts/tick with fresh
   query params — reuse members.
8. **`WaterRippleSim`**: ~16 `set_shader_parameter`/frame of which 4–6 are
   constants; 3 drop params written even when inert.

## 7. Optimization brainstorm

### A. Kill the terrain-loading failure (highest impact)

1. **Ship pins for the shipped seed.** The world seed is pinned in
   `world.tscn`; run the existing seed-corpus harness offline for
   `2697992464`'s reachable cities and bundle the resulting
   `warren_solution_pins.json` as a res:// default (user:// overlays it).
   Sealed pins re-seal in ~10 s and failure pins are free — the in-game
   search should be a fallback, not the common path. This alone removes
   ~90 s of the live startup and the 45–75 s streaming stalls near the
   spawn settlements.
2. **Move the warren search off the terrain worker** (second thread with its
   own `WorldFieldBlockCache`; solver state is already self-contained, pin
   cache writes are the only shared artifact). `record_for` returns a
   "pending" record immediately; feature blocks that only await a village
   solve report ready-with-placeholder so terrain integrates now and the
   village pops in when sealed (or fade/scaffold it in). The worker then
   never stalls > ~2 s.
3. **Relax the integration gate.** Let terrain commit when its halo blocks
   are pending *only on a village solve* (terrain geometry doesn't depend on
   it in route-first mode — `make_relief` is inert). Keep the player-freeze
   tied to terrain collision + the chunk's own features only.
4. **Priority hygiene** (cheap, do regardless):
   - Recompute `priority_distance` from the current centre when re-requesting
     (assign, don't `mini`), and drop queued terrain jobs > CHUNK_RADIUS+1
     from centre (mirror the grass cancellation).
   - Give startup support chunks a dedicated tier below everything else, and
     make gate-blocking halo feature jobs inherit tier 0.
   - Put grass at the bottom tier (or only above terrain inside FULL_RADIUS).
   - Add a motion bias: effective_distance −1 for chunks within ±45° of the
     velocity direction.

### B. Startup wall-time

5. **Persist the cold water trace/region cache** keyed by (seed, salt) —
   ~28 s of every boot is recomputing identical pure data for a pinned seed.
   Serialize after first trace (or bake at export). Fallback: keep the
   compute but overlap it with a second worker meshing the support chunks —
   region builds only need the fill/trace for wet chunks.
6. **Compile programs off the main thread / cache them.** The 1.8 s `_ready`
   block (SettlementFabricProgram 981 ms + dressing 460 ms + catalog probes)
   can run on the worker before its first job, or be cached as a built
   resource; the window and loading screen then appear ~2 s sooner.
7. **Warm particle/shader pipelines during the loading screen** (one hidden
   GPUParticles3D per material + the water/ripple shaders) to remove
   first-chunk hitches at gate-open.

### C. Chunk throughput (makes everything resilient)

8. **Broad-phase the path overlay.** Precompute once per chunk whether any
   path/feature surface intersects it (features.context already knows);
   skip `_emit_path_surface` candidacy entirely for the ~majority of quads
   in path-free cells. Expected to remove a large slice of the 1.12 s mesh
   phase (~230 k probe calls today).
9. **Flat-cell fast path.** Cells whose baked 13×13 samples are constant
   (most meadow cells) emit 2 triangles instead of 288; tint continuity is
   preserved by the existing corner-lattice interpolation.
10. **Batch vertex emission.** Replace per-vertex SurfaceTool calls with
    directly-built PackedArrays (positions/uv/color/index) — one
    `commit`-equivalent per surface; skip `index()` by emitting indexed
    quads natively. 55 k × ~3 native calls → ~10 array writes.
11. If still needed: adaptive `SAMPLES_PER_CELL` (12 on slope bands, 4–6 on
    flats), or port the quad loop to GDExtension. A second general terrain
    worker thread is also viable once the caches are split per-thread —
    but items 8–10 likely triple throughput in GDScript alone.

### D. Frame-time cleanups (normal play)

12. §6 items 1–8, in that order: overlay off, `_corners` allocation-free,
    trample epoch amortized + static rebuild keyed to trample-range chunks,
    streamer sweeps gated on centre change, grass origin quantized, cached
    physics/anim handles, reused camera query params, dirty-flagged shader
    params.

### Expected outcome (rough)

| | today | after A+B | after A–C |
|---|---|---|---|
| First boot near settlements | 150–250 s | ~30–40 s (cold water still paid once) | **~8–15 s** |
| Warm boot | ~40 s live | ~10 s | **~5 s** |
| Streaming stall near unsolved village | 45–75 s × N chunks, world frozen | none (search off-thread / pinned) | none |
| Sustained chunk rate | 0.74/s | 0.74/s | **~2–3/s** |

---

## 8. Addendum (2026-08-16): inside the warren search — where 70–400 s per settlement goes

Follow-up profiling of `WarrenVolumetricSolver.solve` on the three city seeds
touched by the spawn halo (isolated probe `probe_warren_spatial_features.gd
--production-only`, plus a temporarily-instrumented `context_for` replay).

### 8.1 A diagnostic flag was changing the search (bug)

`WarrenVolumetricSolver.gd:~1180-1204`: the wip checkpoint `80dc605`
(2026-08-12) inserted `_rank_courtyard_candidates_for_macro(...)` and a
`SKYWALK_TIMING` block between `if requires_courtyard:` and its `else:`, so
the `else: raw_court_candidates.append(_absent_courtyard_bridge_candidate())`
silently re-attached to `if diagnostic_trace_skywalk_timing:`. Consequences:

- **Production** (flag off), compact/standard profiles
  (`requires_elevated_courtyard = false`): the sentinel candidate is appended
  → the full market/landmark/skywalk joint beam runs → *intended* but slow.
  Large/grand (`true`): a bogus "no courtyard" candidate is added on top of
  the real ones — extra work and a possible court-less seal for a profile
  that requires a court.
- **Every `--timing` harness/probe run** (flag on): compact/standard get *no*
  court candidate → the market attempt fails immediately → the search is
  ~16× faster **and different from what the game ships**. Seed 3910 standard:
  **23.4 s with `--timing`, 367.5 s without**. Corpus/pin results gathered
  under the flag do not reflect production.

Fix (in working tree, uncommitted): move the `else` back to
`if requires_courtyard:`.

### 8.2 True production breakdown, seed 3910 standard (365.6 s, exhausted)

| stage | n | total | per |
|---|---|---|---|
| frontier (excavation carve, 256 bores each) | 12 | 11.0 s | 0.9 s |
| `partition_spatial` rejected (beam empty / composition failed) | 30 | 93.7 s | 3.1 s |
| `partition_spatial` accepted = 3D room composition | 34 | **197.5 s** | 5.8 s |
| `partition_fabric` compile | 34 | **62.1 s** | 1.8 s |

Of the 34 variants that survived composition + fabric (~7.6 s each), **26
were rejected by the sightline caps** ("N through sightlines; maximum 48",
"ground … maximum 20") and 8 by fabric setback/roof gates. I.e. **~200 s of
365 s is spent fully building towns that fail a count check at the very
end.**

Two structural facts make that avoidable:

1. **The precomposition proxy already computes the sightline counts**
   (`_precomposition_enclosure_audit` → `through_sightline_count`,
   `ground_through_sightline_count`) and uses them only to *rank*
   (`_precomposition_quality_score`), never to reject. Observed proxy vs
   compiled: proxy 98–128 → compiled 74–104 (all fail); proxy 60 → 69–96
   (fail); proxy 6 → 50–117 (fail — proxy under-predicts here). Rejecting
   source volumes whose proxy exceeds the cap by a safety margin (e.g. > 78)
   would have skipped 6 of the 8 source volumes (~48 of 64 variants) before
   any composition. Needs corpus validation for zero false rejections.
2. **The 8 partition variants of one source volume fail the same way**
   (sightlines are a street-network property; variants change room choices,
   per the code's own comment). Per-source results: 91/74/91 · 104/80/104 ·
   93/93/93/89 · 97/97/97 · 85/86/86/86. A "topology-bound failure → skip the
   source's remaining variants" memo removes ~7/8 of that cost. Same for
   "final 3D room composition lost structural bearing" (4/8 variants on two
   sources, ~4 s each).

Also: `WarrenExcavationCarver.carve` runs 256 bores (~3.4 ms each) per outer
attempt and selects by `_candidate_score`, which ignores the topology gate
that runs immediately afterwards ("walk cells ≥ 12", "ramp transitions ≥ 1")
— on the compact seed all 12 × 256 bores were discarded by it. Filtering
inside the bore loop would let attempts produce candidates instead of a
guaranteed 0.9 s miss.

### 8.3 Per-settlement production numbers (instrumented `context_for` replay)

| city seed / profile | in-game slices | isolated full search |
|---|---|---|
| 166… compact | 8.7 s (12 attempts, no candidates) | 8.5 s |
| 6357… standard | 24.3 + 57.0 + 5.1 s (3 slices) | 12.1 s *with flag* (true path not measured) |
| 3910… standard | 34.7 + 20.5 s (2 slices, 3 of 12 attempts) | 23.4 s with flag / **367.5 s true** |

The 20 s budget's uncapped first attempt is why single slices hit 35–57 s.

### 8.4 Expected effect

Fix 8.1 + proxy sightline pre-gate + per-source failure memo + carver
gate-aware selection: seed 3910's exhausted search ≈ 365 s → ~40–60 s (11 s
carving + a handful of genuinely ambiguous compositions), and successful
seals arrive earlier because fewer doomed variants precede the winner. This
does not remove the need for the async/placeholder work (a hard seed still
costs tens of seconds), but shrinks placeholder dwell time ~5–8×.

### 8.5 Sub-project A0 result (2026-08-16, branch feat/async-settlement-resolution)

Implemented (TDD, `tests/test_warren_search_pregates.gd`, 11 tests):

1. `WarrenVolumetricSolver.precomposition_pregate_failure` — a source
   volume whose *precomposition* through-sightline proxy exceeds the cap by
   `PRECOMPOSITION_SIGHTLINE_MARGIN` (30 → limit 78) is dropped in
   `_ranked_precomposition_variants` before any variant reaches composition.
   Ground sightlines are not pre-gated (proxy under-predicts).
2. `is_topology_bound_quality_failure` + a per-source retirement memo in
   `_solve_frontier`: a compiled **through**-sightline count > 1.5 × cap
   retires the source's remaining variants. Ground counts were tried and
   **withdrawn by the oracle**: seed 3613… attempt 0 compiled 35 ground
   sightlines on `gallery0/v4` while `gallery0/v3` (the recorded winner)
   seals — ground daylight is variant-dependent.
3. `WarrenExcavationCarver.carve_ranked` (`carve()` = its head) +
   `WarrenTownSolver._gate_preferred_volume`, shared by the staged frontier
   and the selected-attempt rebuild: the first ranked bore survivor that
   passes the public-realm topology gate is taken (`TOPOLOGY_GATE_CANDIDATES
   = 8`); the score-best is still reported when none passes. Compact seed
   166… went from 0 candidates in 12 attempts to candidates on attempts
   5/7/8/11.
4. `WarrenSolutionPinCache.GENERATION_SALT` → `2026-08-16a`.

Oracle (`tests/harness/warren_search_oracle.gd`, unbudgeted
`WarrenVolumetricSolver.solve`, true production path; baseline = commit
54e625d in a worktree):

| 7 standard | 9.5 s | 9.2 s | **seal = seal**, attempt 4 / variant 0, sig `707e0d22b2a8` identical |

Total 955.8 s → 437.7 s; the typical exhausted search drops from ~65 s to
~11 s (6×), the worst from 373 s to 44 s (8×); both recorded sealing towns are
bit-identical. Related GUT suites (volumetric_solver 43/45, massif 12/13,
inhabited_massif 3/5, generation_mode 5/8, spatial_fabric_compiler 9/10,
settlement_relief 16/17, solid_partitioner 21/25,
excavation 6/17+7 risky, excavation_adapter 5/11, interstitial_joins 7/7,
fabric_roof_topology 9/9) have identical pass/fail counts before and after
— the non-passing cases pre-date A0.

Not addressed here: seed 3613's 175 s is ranking (six variants composed
before the winner) — a better precomposition score, not a gate.

### 8.6 Why the sightline gate fails (evidence for a constructive fix)

Measured on 3910…/attempt 11 (fails, proxy 101) and 3613…/attempt 0
`gallery0` (seals, proxy 20) with throwaway probes:

- A *through sightline* is an eye-height chord from a route cell that leaves
  the core in **both** directions without hitting **building** mass
  (`SettlementFabricSolver._audit_sightlines`); the massif's own rock does
  not occlude because unassigned mass is discarded (`_discard_unassigned_mass`).
- 3910: 216 eye-height flank sides along the street; **198 solid massif**,
  185 house-capable (≥ 4 bands above the floor); only **108 proposed** →
  101 chords. **With all mass kept as occluders: 0 chords** (3613: 176 solid,
  112 proposed, 20 chords → 0).
- Route straightness is not the cause: the carver already caps runs at
  `MAX_STRAIGHT_RUN = 4`.
- `WarrenSolidPartitioner.street_wall_audit`: 3910 = 74 raw walls → owned 32,
  plinth 12, kerb 13, undermined 8, short 9, unowned 0. 3613 = 64 → 29 / 13 /
  13 / 7 / 2 / 0. The partitioner honours its contract; the contract houses
  ~45 % of walls and trims the rest to air by policy (spec §3). Near-identical
  buckets on the sealing and failing town — the *arrangement* of gaps decides.
- `_fill_free_solid` (the interior-infill pass) places **0** houses on both:
  every column beside a public cell is already claimed (251/…) or carved
  (151/…) at `_top_band`; the interior 66 % of the hill is unaddressable.
- Lanes — the mechanism meant to open the interior (lane curve 30 → 74 mean
  houses was measured on radius-12 towns) — are 0–3 per town at the reviewed
  village scale (3910: 2 lanes/11 cells; 3613: 1/6; 6357: 3/13; 7: 0; 166: 0).

So at village scale the topology is a one-house-deep skin along a canyon,
and whether the compiled town passes the sightline caps depends on where the
skin's policy-trimmed gaps line up — hence compose-then-reject.

### 8.7 Decision + O2 experiment (2026-08-16)

Decision (Ryan): the sightline caps were guidance for the intended look, not
a hard rule; enclosure should come from density. Landed:
`production_quality_failure` no longer rejects on through/ground sightlines
(overhead and alley ratios stay hard); the A0 pre-gate and per-source memo,
which hard-rejected on the same metric, are removed; the precomposition
ranking's proxy penalties remain the only sightline influence.

O2 (density via lanes) was measured before touching production rules, with
`tests/harness/warren_density_probe.gd` (frontier level, 9 seeds × 12
attempts) and two experiment knobs (`WarrenExcavationCarver.lane_reserve_radius`,
`lane_reserve_clearance_bands` paired with
`WarrenGroundArcadeSolver.auxiliary_separation_clearance_bands`; defaults =
production). Why lanes fail today: of ~11–14 anchors per town, 11–13 cannot
make a first move — the arcade reserve (`LANE_ARCADE_RESERVE_CELLS = 4`
around every grade route cell) covers 56–58 of ~120–135 columns.

| variant | candidates/108 | arcade fails | lanes/cand | lane cells | houses/cand | mass ratio | proxy through | proxy overhead |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| baseline | 51 | 31 | 0.92 | 4.2 | 19.4 | 0.325 | 80 | 0.003 |
| reserve radius 2 | 43 | 50 | 1.49 | 7.3 | 18.8 | 0.305 | 86 | 0.000 |
| clearance 6 bands | 50 | 31 | 1.02 | 4.8 | 19.2 | 0.324 | 84 | 0.001 |
| clearance 4 bands | 57 | 28 | 1.42 | 6.5 | 19.1 | 0.305 | 85 | 0.001 |
| radius 2 + clearance 6 | 45 | 48 | 1.51 | 7.3 | 18.7 | 0.305 | 87 | 0.000 |

More lanes do **not** raise house count at village scale (flat ~19/candidate),
slightly worsen enclosure (lanes cut mass; proxy through +5–7), and a smaller
reserve costs arcade candidates. Per seed, the two sealing towns (3613…, 7)
have proxy through 44/39 and ground 12/22; failing seeds 91–165 — enclosure
tracks route/massif shape, not lanes (seed 8702… has 3.5 lanes and through
161). Front-rank houses are 1–2 columns (`footprint_families` 1cell 11–15,
2cell 6–9, 4cell 1–2) because deeper footprints span more terrace relief
(`footprint_fits_plinth_budget`, terrace tops). The precomposition overhead
proxy is ~0 for every candidate: compiled overhead comes entirely from
composition (skywalks/bridges), and that gate stays hard.

Conclusion: at radius 7–8 the density lever is not lanes; it is footprint
depth / how the front rank consumes interior mass (or courtyard/back-plot
addressing) — a partitioner/massif-shape question for Ryan's design, not a
tuning change. The reserve knobs are left at production defaults.

Oracle under the guidance policy (vs the A0 state):

| seed | A0 | guidance |
|---|---|---|
| 4242 std | 11.6 s fail | 61 s fail — all 8 variants fail composition (5 "authored room envelope: bridge room", 3 "retained arbitrary exposed") |
| 991177 compact | 154 s fail | 182 s fail |
| 3046… std | 11.6 s fail | 173 s fail |
| 2697… compact | 11.2 s fail | 182 s fail |
| 166… compact | 9.8 s fail | **79 s seal** (attempt 5 / v3, sig 0f1608f8dc9b) — new town |
| 3910… std | 44 s fail | 448 s fail |
| 6357… std | 10.8 s fail | 80 s fail |
| 3613… std | 175 s seal (att 0 / v3) | **20 s seal** (att 2 / v2, sig 24122fd46b32) — an earlier variant the cap used to reject |
| 7 std | 9.2 s seal | 10.8 s seal, identical |

Seal rate 2/9 → 3/9 and the look-policy is honoured, but exhaustive failures
are 5–15× slower because doomed sources are now fully composed. They are
doomed by **composition** (bearing / authored room envelope), which the proxy
sightline count was predicting — and which the pre-gate would also have used
to block 166's new town. The next constructive frontier is therefore the
room composition stage: why village-scale front ranks cannot compose.

### 8.8 Why composed towns are rejected (gate trace, 9 seeds, guidance policy)

Full production solves with `--timing --gate-trace`; 211 rejected partition
variants, 156 in composition, 41 at quality gates, 14 in fabric; **1,208 s**
spent on rejected variants in total.

| class | time | n | nature |
|---|---|---|---|
| `compact/standard partition formed N inhabited rooms; expected A..B` (`room_volume_budget`, compact 10..30 / standard 16..60) | **464 s (38 %)** | 85 | size quota checked after the ~5 s composition; compact towns compose **31–48** rooms on every variant of three seeds, standard 61–66 |
| `alley-bounded walk ratio N is below 0.300` (standard-only regression floor from a 6-seed corpus) | **364 s (30 %)** | 34 | enclosure/character metric checked after fabric (~7 s); values 0.09–0.299, mostly 0.25–0.30 near-misses |
| `joint hero-feature beam found court=0, 0 landmarks, 0 skywalks` | small (~0.4 s each) | 27 | cheap early miss |
| bridge room has no built flank / lost structural bearing / retained arbitrary exposed shoulders / room-scale outcroppings unsupported / skywalk fits | ~200 s (17 %) | ~40 | genuinely structural composition failures |
| overhead ratio, fabric setback/envelope, misc | ~180 s | ~50 | mixed |

So ~70 % of village-scale composition waste is two thresholds applied after
the expensive work, not structural inability. Sealed towns for reference:
7 (standard) stacks 48, alley/overhead 0.55; 3613… stacks 49, overhead 0.54,
through 52 / ground 27; 166… (compact) stacks 24, overhead 0.43, through 144.

### 8.9 Decision: all enclosure/size metrics are guidance (2026-08-16)

Ryan: "all of this is guidance, not hard ratios." Landed: the post-composition
quality gate (`production_quality_failure`: overhead ratio, alley ratio —
sightlines were already removed) is deleted with its three solver call sites
and two adapter call sites; the inhabited-room range check is removed (the
budget stays in the audit). Structural gates (bearing, envelopes, fabric
compile, topology) are untouched. `GENERATION_SALT` → `2026-08-16b`.

Oracle:

| seed | A0 | sightlines guidance | all guidance |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4242 std | 11.6 s fail | 61 s fail | 62 s fail (composition: envelope / exposed shoulders) |
| 991177 compact | 154 s fail | 182 s fail | **22.6 s seal** (att 6 / v0, 8f366f4ec0f3) |
| 3046… std | 11.6 s fail | 173 s fail | **17.5 s seal** (att 0 / v4, 1a5db282bad6) |
| 2697… compact | 11.2 s fail | 182 s fail | **6.4 s seal** (att 8 / v7, d5328bca744e) |
| 166… compact | 9.8 s fail | 79 s seal | **24.1 s seal** (att 11 / v1, 896fa2468af2) |
| 3910… std | 44 s fail | 448 s fail | **12.3 s seal** (att 11 / v4, ae9d0d98fa72) |
| 6357… std | 10.8 s fail | 80 s fail | **16.3 s seal** (att 5 / v3, 3ee735d9d6bf) |
| 3613… std | 175 s seal | 20 s seal | 19.5 s seal (same town, 24122fd46b32) |
| 7 std | 9.2 s seal | 10.8 s seal | 10.8 s seal (identical, 707e0d22b2a8) |

**Seal rate 2/9 → 8/9; every sealing town in 6–24 s; total 191 s** (vs
1,236 s under sightlines-only guidance and 438 s under A0). The towns were
composable all along; the thresholds were the wall. Enclosure/density now
rests on the ranking terms and on Ryan's visual review of what seals.

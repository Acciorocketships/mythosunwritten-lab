# Mythos loading screen

`mythos_loading_screen.tscn` is the project's startup scene. It requests
`scenes/world.tscn` through Godot's threaded resource loader, polls progress
without blocking the main loop, then installs the loaded world behind a
high-layer overlay. The overlay remains until `FieldTerrainStreamer` reports
that every terrain chunk beneath the player's startup footprint is integrated.
At the origin corner that support set is exactly `(-1,-1)`, `(-1,0)`, `(0,-1)`,
and `(0,0)`.

The bottom hairline is `MythosTaperedProgressBar`, not a timer. Three percent is
Godot's threaded scene-resource load. The remaining range combines measured
worker milestones for FeatureContext, heightfield, meshing, water, and
dressing across the four startup support jobs and their required feature halo,
then the actual main-thread integration fraction. The streamer prioritizes that
support work ahead of its normal outward radius. The bar's small `preview` cycle
exists only in the screenshot harness and is disabled in production.

The original atlas is paired with `mythos_mythic_atlas_background_cloudless.png`,
a genuinely cloud-free parchment plate with the foreground illustration removed.
The earlier plate retained stationary corner clouds and must not be used behind
the moving layer. Dedicated transparent textures under `layers/` contain the
cities, clouds, and celestial chart:

- four cloud banks drift independently using translation only (never rotation);
- the left and right settlements move on separate slow parallax paths;
- the stationary river is the original atlas painting; a second sample of those
  exact pixels scrolls downstream along a hand-fitted centreline for most of a
  cycle, cross-fading only at wrap. Its motion is clipped to a narrower inner
  channel than the stationary painted banks. Fine low-contrast wavelets stay
  horizontal in screen space for the atlas perspective while texture advection
  continues to follow the spline;
- only `layers/chart.png` rotates, carrying its constellations with it;
- the parchment plate, title, and separate progress Control never rotate.

The ShaderMaterial parameters on the scene are the art-direction controls. The
cloud/city parallax, localized river flow, and chart rotation are deliberately
readable over the multi-chunk startup wait.

To preview and validate the GPU motion without entering the game, run:

```sh
godot --path /Users/ryko/story res://tests/harness/loading_screen_preview.tscn
```

The harness compares two rendered frames and writes the later one to
`user://mythos_loading_screen_preview.png`.

The real-world startup handoff (including monotonic measured progress during
worker planning and automatic dismissal without player input) is covered by:

```sh
godot --headless --path /Users/ryko/story \
  res://tests/harness/loading_world_startup.tscn
```
